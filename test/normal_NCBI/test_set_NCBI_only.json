[["Genetic mapping of the copper toxicosis locus in Bedlington terriers to dog chromosome 10, in a region syntenic to human chromosome region 2p13-p16.\nAbnormal hepatic copper accumulation is recognized as an inherited disorder in man, mouse, rat and dog. The major cause of hepatic copper accumulation in man is a dysfunctional ATP7B gene, causing Wilson disease (WD). Mutations in the ATP7B genes have also been demonstrated in mouse and rat. The ATP7B gene has been excluded in the much rarer human copper overload disease non-Indian childhood cirrhosis, indicating genetic heterogeneity. By investigating the common autosomal recessive copper toxicosis (CT) in Bedlington terriers, we have identified a new locus involved in progressive liver disease. We examined whether the WD gene ATP7B was also causative for CT by investigating the chromosomal co-localization of ATP7B and C04107, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). C04107 is an anonymous microsatellite marker closely linked to CT. However, BAC clones containing ATP7B and C04107 mapped to the canine chromosome regions CFA22q11 and CFA10q26, respectively, demonstrating that WD cannot be homologous to CT. The copper transport genes CTR1 and CTR2 were also excluded as candidate genes for CT since they both mapped to canine chromosome region CFA11q22. 2-22. 5. A transcribed sequence identified from the C04107-containing BAC was found to be homologous to a gene expressed from human chromosome 2p13-p16, a region devoid of any positional candidate genes. \n", {"entities": [[326, 331, "GENE"], [384, 389, "GENE"], [446, 451, "GENE"], [785, 790, "GENE"], [869, 874, "GENE"], [1034, 1039, "GENE"], [326, 331, "GENE"], [384, 389, "GENE"], [446, 451, "GENE"], [785, 790, "GENE"], [869, 874, "GENE"], [1034, 1039, "GENE"], [326, 331, "GENE"], [384, 389, "GENE"], [446, 451, "GENE"], [785, 790, "GENE"], [869, 874, "GENE"], [1034, 1039, "GENE"], [326, 331, "GENE"], [384, 389, "GENE"], [446, 451, "GENE"], [785, 790, "GENE"], [869, 874, "GENE"], [1034, 1039, "GENE"], [326, 331, "GENE"], [384, 389, "GENE"], [446, 451, "GENE"], [785, 790, "GENE"], [869, 874, "GENE"], [1034, 1039, "GENE"], [326, 331, "GENE"], [384, 389, "GENE"], [446, 451, "GENE"], [785, 790, "GENE"], [869, 874, "GENE"], [1034, 1039, "GENE"], [23, 39, "DISEASE"], [158, 185, "DISEASE"], [206, 224, "DISEASE"], [272, 299, "DISEASE"], [346, 360, "DISEASE"], [362, 364, "DISEASE"], [499, 514, "DISEASE"], [523, 553, "DISEASE"], [637, 653, "DISEASE"], [655, 657, "DISEASE"], [738, 751, "DISEASE"], [777, 779, "DISEASE"], [814, 816, "DISEASE"], [999, 1001, "DISEASE"], [1147, 1149, "DISEASE"], [1174, 1176, "DISEASE"], [1261, 1263, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Molecular analysis of the APC gene in 205 families: extended genotype-phenotype correlations in FAP and evidence for the role of APC amino acid changes in colorectal cancer predisposition.\nBACKGROUND/AIMS  The development of colorectal cancer and a variable range of extracolonic manifestations in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is the result of the dominant inheritance of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations. In this study, direct mutation analysis of the APC gene was performed to determine genotype-phenotype correlations for nine extracolonic manifestations and to investigate the incidence of APC mutations in non-FAP colorectal cancer. METHODS  The APC gene was analysed in 190 unrelated FAP and 15 non-FAP colorectal cancer patients using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, the protein truncation test, and direct sequencing. RESULTS  Chain terminating signals were only identified in patients belonging to the FAP group (105 patients). Amino acid changes were identified in four patients, three of whom belonged to the non-FAP group of colorectal cancer patients. Genotype-phenotype correlations identified significant differences in the nature of certain extracolonic manifestations in FAP patients belonging to three mutation subgroups. CONCLUSIONS  Extended genotype-phenotype correlations made in this study may have the potential to determine the most appropriate surveillance and prophylactic treatment regimens for those patients with mutations associated with life threatening conditions. This study also provided evidence for the pathological nature of amino acid changes in APC associated with both FAP and non-FAP colorectal cancer patients.. \n", {"entities": [[26, 29, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [408, 411, "GENE"], [476, 479, "GENE"], [617, 620, "GENE"], [674, 677, "GENE"], [1617, 1620, "GENE"], [96, 99, "GENE"], [330, 333, "GENE"], [638, 641, "GENE"], [713, 716, "GENE"], [728, 731, "GENE"], [943, 946, "GENE"], [1056, 1059, "GENE"], [1220, 1223, "GENE"], [1642, 1645, "GENE"], [1654, 1657, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [408, 411, "GENE"], [476, 479, "GENE"], [617, 620, "GENE"], [674, 677, "GENE"], [1617, 1620, "GENE"], [96, 99, "GENE"], [330, 333, "GENE"], [638, 641, "GENE"], [713, 716, "GENE"], [728, 731, "GENE"], [943, 946, "GENE"], [1056, 1059, "GENE"], [1220, 1223, "GENE"], [1642, 1645, "GENE"], [1654, 1657, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [408, 411, "GENE"], [476, 479, "GENE"], [617, 620, "GENE"], [674, 677, "GENE"], [1617, 1620, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [408, 411, "GENE"], [476, 479, "GENE"], [617, 620, "GENE"], [674, 677, "GENE"], [1617, 1620, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [408, 411, "GENE"], [476, 479, "GENE"], [617, 620, "GENE"], [674, 677, "GENE"], [1617, 1620, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [408, 411, "GENE"], [476, 479, "GENE"], [617, 620, "GENE"], [674, 677, "GENE"], [1617, 1620, "GENE"], [96, 99, "GENE"], [330, 333, "GENE"], [638, 641, "GENE"], [713, 716, "GENE"], [728, 731, "GENE"], [943, 946, "GENE"], [1056, 1059, "GENE"], [1220, 1223, "GENE"], [1642, 1645, "GENE"], [1654, 1657, "GENE"], [96, 99, "GENE"], [330, 333, "GENE"], [638, 641, "GENE"], [713, 716, "GENE"], [728, 731, "GENE"], [943, 946, "GENE"], [1056, 1059, "GENE"], [1220, 1223, "GENE"], [1642, 1645, "GENE"], [1654, 1657, "GENE"], [96, 99, "GENE"], [330, 333, "GENE"], [638, 641, "GENE"], [713, 716, "GENE"], [728, 731, "GENE"], [943, 946, "GENE"], [1056, 1059, "GENE"], [1220, 1223, "GENE"], [1642, 1645, "GENE"], [1654, 1657, "GENE"], [26, 29, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [408, 411, "GENE"], [476, 479, "GENE"], [617, 620, "GENE"], [674, 677, "GENE"], [1617, 1620, "GENE"], [96, 99, "GENE"], [330, 333, "GENE"], [638, 641, "GENE"], [713, 716, "GENE"], [728, 731, "GENE"], [943, 946, "GENE"], [1056, 1059, "GENE"], [1220, 1223, "GENE"], [1642, 1645, "GENE"], [1654, 1657, "GENE"], [26, 29, "DISEASE"], [96, 99, "DISEASE"], [129, 132, "DISEASE"], [155, 172, "DISEASE"], [225, 242, "DISEASE"], [298, 328, "DISEASE"], [330, 333, "DISEASE"], [380, 406, "DISEASE"], [408, 411, "DISEASE"], [476, 479, "DISEASE"], [617, 620, "DISEASE"], [642, 659, "DISEASE"], [674, 677, "DISEASE"], [713, 716, "DISEASE"], [732, 749, "DISEASE"], [943, 946, "DISEASE"], [1069, 1086, "DISEASE"], [1220, 1223, "DISEASE"], [1642, 1645, "DISEASE"], [1658, 1675, "DISEASE"]]}], ["A European multicenter study of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: classification of 105 mutations and a general system for genotype-based prediction of metabolic phenotype.\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Previous studies have suggested that the highly variable metabolic phenotypes of PAH deficiency correlate with PAH genotypes. We identified both causative mutations in 686 patients from seven European centers. On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics of 297 functionally hemizygous patients, 105 of the mutations were assigned to one of four arbitrary phenotype categories. We proposed and tested a simple model for correlation between genotype and phenotypic outcome. The observed phenotype matched the predicted phenotype in 79% of the cases, and in only 5 of 184 patients was the observed phenotype more than one category away from that expected. Among the seven contributing centers, the proportion of patients for whom the observed phenotype did not match the predicted phenotype was 4% -23% (P <. 0001), suggesting that differences in methods used for mutation detection or phenotype classification may account for a considerable proportion of genotype-phenotype inconsistencies. Our data indicate that the PAH-mutation genotype is the main determinant of metabolic phenotype in most patients with PAH deficiency. In the present study, the classification of 105 PAH mutations may allow the prediction of the biochemical phenotype in > 10, 000 genotypes, which may be useful for the management of hyperphenylalaninemia in newborns. \n", {"entities": [[32, 68, "DISEASE"], [177, 192, "DISEASE"], [194, 197, "DISEASE"], [203, 229, "DISEASE"], [231, 234, "DISEASE"], [240, 257, "DISEASE"], [413, 427, "DISEASE"], [1442, 1456, "DISEASE"], [1640, 1661, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Disruption of splicing regulated by a CUG-binding protein in myotonic dystrophy.\nMyotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3 untranslated region of the DM gene.

The analysis of tumors from 54 (71%) of 76 informative patients showed loss of constitutional heterozygosity (LOH) at intragenic loci. Three of 13 uninformative patients had constitutional deletions. For 39 randomly selected tumors, SSCP, hetero-duplex analysis, sequencing, and Southern blot analysis were used to identify mutations. Mutations were detected in 21 (91%) of 23 tumors with LOH. In 6 (38%) of 16 tumors without LOH, one mutation was detected, and in 9 (56%) of the tumors without LOH, both mutations were found. Thus, a total of 45 mutations were identified in tumors of 36 patients. Thirty-nine of the mutations-including 34 small mutations, 2 large structural alterations, and hypermethylation in 3 tumors-were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood DNA. In 6 (17%) of the 36 patients, a mutation was detected in constitutional DNA, and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity. The presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment. In 1 patient, somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood. In 2 patients without a detectable mutation in peripheral blood, mosaicism was suggested because 1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors and the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma.

The extraordinary conservation of the PAX6 protein at the amino acid level amongst vertebrates predicts that pathological missense mutations should in fact be common even though they are hardly ever seen in aniridia patients. This indicates that there is a heavy ascertainment bias in the selection of patients for PAX6 mutation analysis and that the missing PAX6 missense mutations frequently may underlie phenotypes distinct from textbook aniridia. Here we present four novel PAX6 missense mutations, two in association with atypical phenotypes  ectopia pupillae (displaced pupils) and congenital nystagmus (searching gaze), and two in association with more recognizable aniridia phenotypes. Strikingly, all four mutations are located within the PAX6 paired domain and affect amino acids which are highly conserved in all known paired domain proteins.

We studied somatic instability by measuring the CTG repeat length at several ages in various tissues of transgenic mice carrying a (CTG) 55expansion surrounded by 45 kb of the human DM region, using small-pool PCR. These mice have been shown to reproduce the intergenerational and somatic instability of the 55 CTG repeat suggesting that surrounding sequences and the chromatin environment are involved in instability mechanisms. As observed in some of the tissues of DM patients, there is a tendency for repeat length and somatic mosaicism to increase with the age of the mouse. Furthermore, we observed no correlation between the somatic mutation rate and tissue proliferation capacity. The somatic mutation rates in different tissues were also not correlated to the relative inter-tissue difference in transcriptional levels of the three genes (DMAHP, DMPK and 59) surrounding the repeat.. \n", {"entities": [[291, 295, "GENE"], [1552, 1556, "GENE"], [291, 295, "GENE"], [1552, 1556, "GENE"], [65, 83, "DISEASE"], [324, 342, "DISEASE"], [344, 346, "DISEASE"], [648, 650, "DISEASE"], [667, 683, "DISEASE"], [879, 881, "DISEASE"], [1165, 1167, "DISEASE"]]}], ["ATM mutations and phenotypes in ataxia-telangiectasia families in the British Isles: expression of mutant ATM and the risk of leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer.\nWe report the spectrum of 59 ATM mutations observed in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients in the British Isles. Of 51 ATM mutations identified in families native to the British Isles, 11 were founder mutations, and 2 of these 11 conferred a milder clinical phenotype with respect to both cerebellar degeneration and cellular features. We report, in two A-T families, an ATM mutation (7271T-- > G) that may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both homozygotes and heterozygotes (relative risk 12. 7; P =. 0025), although there is a less severe A-T phenotype in terms of the degree of cerebellar degeneration. This mutation (7271T-- > G) also allows expression of full-length ATM protein at a level comparable with that in unaffected individuals. In addition, we have studied 18 A-T patients, in 15 families, who developed leukemia, lymphoma, preleukemic T-cell proliferation, or Hodgkin lymphoma, mostly in childhood. A wide variety of ATM mutation types, including missense mutations and in-frame deletions, were seen in these patients.

Hereditary Ovarian Cancer Clinical Study Group.\nBACKGROUND  Women with mutations in either the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene have a high lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Oral contraceptives protect against ovarian cancer in general, but it is not known whether they also protect against hereditary forms of ovarian cancer. METHODS  We enrolled 207 women with hereditary ovarian cancer and 161 of their sisters as controls in a case-control study. All the patients carried a pathogenic mutation in either BRCA1 (179 women) or BRCA2 (28 women). The control women were enrolled regardless of whether or not they had either mutation. Lifetime histories of oral-contraceptive use were obtained by interview or by written questionnaire and were compared between patients and control women, after adjustment for year of birth and parity. RESULTS  The adjusted odds ratio for ovarian cancer associated with any past use of oral contraceptives was 0. 5 (95 percent confidence interval, 0. 3 to 0. 8). The risk decreased with increasing duration of use (P for trend, < 0. 001); use for six or more years was associated with a 60 percent reduction in risk. Oral-contraceptive use protected against ovarian cancer both for carriers of the BRCA1 mutation (odds ratio, 0. 5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 3 to 0. 9) and for carriers of the BRCA2 mutation (odds ratio, 0. 4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 2 to 1. 1).

To identify founder effects, we examined independently ascertained French Canadian cancer families for the distribution of these eight mutations. Mutations were found in 41 of 97 families. Six of eight mutations were observed at least twice. The BRCA1 C4446T mutation was the most common mutation found, followed by the BRCA2 8765delAG mutation. Together, these mutations were found in 28 of 41 families identified to have a mutation. The odds of detection of any of the four BRCA1 mutations was 18. 7x greater if one or more cases of ovarian cancer were also present in the family. The odds of detection of any of the four BRCA2 mutations was 5. 3x greater if there were at least five cases of breast cancer in the family. Interestingly, the presence of a breast cancer case < 36 years of age was strongly predictive of the presence of any of the eight mutations screened. Carriers of the same mutation, from different families, shared similar haplotypes, indicating that the mutant alleles were likely to be identical by descent for a mutation in the founder population. The identification of common BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations will facilitate carrier detection in French Canadian breast cancer and breast/ovarian cancer families.\n", {"entities": [[8, 13, "GENE"], [174, 179, "GENE"], [518, 523, "GENE"], [748, 753, "GENE"], [1374, 1379, "GENE"], [18, 23, "GENE"], [184, 189, "GENE"], [592, 597, "GENE"], [896, 901, "GENE"], [1384, 1389, "GENE"], [8, 13, "GENE"], [174, 179, "GENE"], [518, 523, "GENE"], [748, 753, "GENE"], [1374, 1379, "GENE"], [18, 23, "GENE"], [184, 189, "GENE"], [592, 597, "GENE"], [896, 901, "GENE"], [1384, 1389, "GENE"], [8, 13, "GENE"], [174, 179, "GENE"], [518, 523, "GENE"], [748, 753, "GENE"], [1374, 1379, "GENE"], [18, 23, "GENE"], [184, 189, "GENE"], [592, 597, "GENE"], [896, 901, "GENE"], [1384, 1389, "GENE"], [8, 13, "GENE"], [174, 179, "GENE"], [518, 523, "GENE"], [748, 753, "GENE"], [1374, 1379, "GENE"], [18, 23, "GENE"], [184, 189, "GENE"], [592, 597, "GENE"], [896, 901, "GENE"], [1384, 1389, "GENE"], [8, 13, "GENE"], [174, 179, "GENE"], [518, 523, "GENE"], [748, 753, "GENE"], [1374, 1379, "GENE"], [18, 23, "GENE"], [184, 189, "GENE"], [592, 597, "GENE"], [896, 901, "GENE"], [1384, 1389, "GENE"], [53, 78, "DISEASE"], [138, 151, "DISEASE"], [210, 223, "DISEASE"], [228, 249, "DISEASE"], [355, 361, "DISEASE"], [807, 821, "DISEASE"], [967, 980, "DISEASE"], [1029, 1042, "DISEASE"], [1453, 1466, "DISEASE"], [1471, 1492, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Truncation mutations in the transactivation region of PAX6 result in dominant-negative mutants.\nPAX6 is a transcription factor with two DNA-binding domains (paired box and homeobox) and a proline-serine-threonine (PST) -rich transactivation domain. PAX6 regulates eye development in animals ranging from jellyfish to Drosophila to humans. Heterozygous mutations in the human PAX6 gene result in various phenotypes, including aniridia, Peters anomaly, autosomal dominant keratitis, and familial foveal dysplasia. It is believed that the mutated allele of PAX6 produces an inactive protein and aniridia is caused due to genetic haploinsufficiency. However, several truncation mutations have been found to occur in the C-terminal half of PAX6 in patients with Aniridia resulting in mutant proteins that retain the DNA-binding domains but have lost most of the transactivation domain. It is not clear whether such mutants really behave as loss-of-function mutants as predicted by haploinsufficiency. Contrary to this theory, our data showed that these mutants are dominant-negative in transient transfection assays when they are coexpressed with wild-type PAX6. We found that the dominant-negative effects result from the enhanced DNA binding ability of these mutants. Kinetic studies of binding and dissociation revealed that various truncation mutants have 3-5-fold higher affinity to various DNA-binding sites when compared with the wild-type PAX6.

Quantitative analysis showed that the expression of CYP27 gene mRNA in the patient represented 52. 5% of the normal level. As the mutation occurred at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 (-2 position of exon 6-intron 6 splice site) of the gene, we hypothesized that the mutation may partially affect the normal splicing efficiency in exon 6 and cause alternative splicing elsewhere, which resulted in decreased transcript in the patient. Transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, into COS-1 cells confirmed that the mutant minigene was responsible for a mRNA species alternatively spliced at an activated cryptic 5 splice site 88 bp upstream from the 3 end of exon 6. Our data suggest that the C to A mutation at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 of the CYP27 gene not only causes the deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, but also partially leads to alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the gene.

Somatic PTEN deletions and mutations were observed in sporadic breast, brain, prostate and kidney cancer cell lines and in several primary tumours such as endometrial carcinomas, malignant melanoma and thyroid tumours. In addition, PTEN was identified as the susceptibility gene for two hamartoma syndromes  Cowden disease (CD; MIM 158350) and Bannayan-Zonana (BZS) or Ruvalcaba-Riley-Smith syndrome (MIM 153480). Constitutive DNA from 37 CD families and seven BZS families was screened for germline PTEN mutations. PTEN mutations were identified in 30 of 37 (81%) CD families, including missense and nonsense point mutations, deletions, insertions, a deletion/insertion and splice site mutations. These mutations were scattered over the entire length of PTEN, with the exception of the first, fourth and last exons. A hot spot for PTEN mutation in CD was identified in exon 5 that contains the PTPase core motif, with 13 of 30 (43%) CD mutations identified in this exon. Seven of 30 (23%) were within the core motif, the majority (five of seven) of which were missense mutations, possibly pointing to the functional significance of this region. Germline PTEN mutations were identified in four of seven (57%) BZS families studied. Interestingly, none of these mutations was observed in the PTPase core motif. It is also worthy of note that a single nonsense point mutation, R233X, was observed in the germline DNA from two unrelated CD families and one BZS family. Genotype-phenotype studies were not performed on this small group of BZS families. However, genotype-phenotype analysis inthe group of CD families revealed two possible associations worthy of follow-up in independent analyses. The first was an association noted in the group of CD families with breast disease. A correlation was observed between the presence/absence of a PTEN mutation and the type of breast involvement (unaffected versus benign versus malignant). Specifically and more directly, an association was also observed between the presence of a PTEN mutation and malignant breast disease. Secondly, there appeared to be an interdependent association between mutations upstream and within the PTPase core motif, the core motif containing the majority of missense mutations, and the involvement of all major organ systems (central nervous system, thyroid, breast, skin and gastrointestinal tract).

The risk of cancer, especially lymphoid neoplasias, is substantially elevated in A-T patients and has long been associated with chromosomal instability. By analysing tumour DNA from patients with sporadic T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), a rare clonal malignancy with similarities to a mature T-cell leukaemia seen in A-T, we demonstrate a high frequency of ATM mutations in T-PLL. In marked contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in A-T, the most frequent nucleotide changes in this leukaemia were missense mutations. These clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain, which is highly conserved in ATM-related proteins in mouse, yeast and Drosophila. The resulting amino-acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with ATP binding or substrate recognition. Two of seventeen mutated T-PLL samples had a previously reported A-T allele. In contrast, no mutations were detected in the p53 gene, suggesting that this tumour suppressor is not frequently altered in this leukaemia. Occasional missense mutations in ATM were also found in tumour DNA from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas (B-NHL) and a B-NHL cell line. The evidence of a significant proportion of loss-of-function mutations and a complete absence of the normal copy of ATM in the majority of mutated tumours establishes somatic inactivation of this gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic T-PLL and suggests that ATM acts as a tumour suppressor.

The deduced protein sequence was classified as a one-pass transmembrane CA possessing an apparently intact catalytic domain in the extracellular CA module. Reintroduced wild-type VHL strongly inhibited the overexpression of the CA12 gene in the parental renal cell carcinoma cell lines. Similar results were obtained with CA9, encoding another transmembrane CA with an intact catalytic domain. Although both domains of the VHL protein contribute to regulation of CA12 expression, the elongin binding domain alone could effectively regulate CA9 expression. We mapped CA12 and CA9 loci to chromosome bands 15q22 and 17q21. 2 respectively, regions prone to amplification in some human cancers.

Less severe, subacute (juvenile-onset) and chronic (adult-onset) variants are characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and are associated with residual levels of Hex A enzyme activity. We identified a 1422 G-- > C (amino acid W474C) substitution in the first position of exon 13 of HEXA of a non-Jewish proband who manifested a subacute variant of G (M2) gangliosidosis. On the second maternally inherited allele, we identified the common infantile disease-causing 4-bp insertion, + TATC 1278, in exon 11. Pulse-chase analysis using proband fibroblasts revealed that the W474C-containing alpha-subunit precursor was normally synthesized, but not phosphorylated or secreted, and the mature lysosomal alpha-subunit was not detected. When the W474C-containing alpha-subunit was transiently co-expressed with the beta-subunit to produce Hex A (alphabeta) in COS-7 cells, the mature alpha-subunit was present, but its level was much lower than that from normal alpha-subunit transfections, although higher than in those cells transfected with an alpha-subunit associated with infantile TSD. Furthermore, the precursor level of the W474C alpha-subunit was found to accumulate in comparison to the normal alpha-subunit precursor levels. We conclude that the 1422 G-- > C mutation is the cause of Hex A enzyme deficiency in the proband. The resulting W474C substitution clearly interferes with alpha-subunit processing, but because the base substitution falls at the first position of exon 13, aberrant splicing may also contribute to Hex A deficiency in this proband.. \n", {"entities": [[133, 153, "DISEASE"], [285, 302, "DISEASE"], [304, 307, "DISEASE"], [320, 367, "DISEASE"], [737, 758, "DISEASE"], [1470, 1473, "DISEASE"], [1678, 1701, "DISEASE"], [1916, 1932, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells.\nMyotonic dystrophy (DM), the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults, is caused by (CTG) n-repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase (DM protein kinase; DMPK) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis. To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis, we have compared the resting [Ca2 +] i, the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced Ca2 + transients, and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild-type and DMPK [-/-] knockout mice. In vitro-differentiated DMPK [-/-] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [Ca2 +] i than do wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2 + and Na + channels. The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K +. In addition, we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l-type Ca2 + channel. Neither the content nor the activity of Na +/K + ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase are affected by DMPK absence.

The overlap in clinical features and the presence, in the same genes, of mutations for more than one craniosynostotic condition-such as Saethre-Chotzen, Crouzon, and Pfeiffer syndromes-support the hypothesis that TWIST and FGFRs are components of the same molecular pathway involved in the modulation of craniofacial and limb development in humans.. \n", {"entities": [[273, 278, "GENE"], [465, 470, "GENE"], [284, 289, "GENE"], [403, 408, "GENE"], [284, 289, "GENE"], [403, 408, "GENE"], [273, 278, "GENE"], [465, 470, "GENE"], [25, 49, "DISEASE"], [131, 155, "DISEASE"], [166, 194, "DISEASE"], [198, 214, "DISEASE"], [219, 233, "DISEASE"], [561, 585, "DISEASE"], [845, 863, "DISEASE"], [865, 878, "DISEASE"], [880, 900, "DISEASE"], [902, 918, "DISEASE"], [920, 926, "DISEASE"], [928, 941, "DISEASE"], [943, 959, "DISEASE"], [965, 977, "DISEASE"], [1197, 1223, "DISEASE"], [1232, 1280, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Frequent inactivation of PTEN/MMAC1 in primary prostate cancer.\nSporadic prostate carcinoma is the most common male cancer in the Western world, yet many of the major genetic events involved in the progression of this often fatal cancer remain to be elucidated. Numerous cytogenetic and allelotype studies have reported frequent loss of heterozygosity on chromosomal arm 10q in sporadic prostate cancer. Deletion mapping studies have unambiguously identified a region of chromosome 10q23 to be the minimal area of loss. A new tumor suppressor gene, PTEN/MMAC1, was isolated recently at this region of chromosome 10q23 and found to be inactivated by mutation in three prostate cancer cell lines. We screened 80 prostate tumors by microsatellite analysis and found chromosome 10q23 to be deleted in 23 cases. We then proceeded with sequence analysis of the entire PTEN/MMAC1 coding region and tested for homozygous deletion with new intragenic markers in these 23 cases with 10q23 loss of heterozygosity.

Previous studies of patients from a British-Irish population showed that the I113F mutation is the most common single mutation among MPS IVA patients and produces a severe clinical phenotype. We studied mutations in the GALNS gene from 23 additional MPS IVA patients (15 from Australia, 8 from Northern Ireland), with various clinical phenotypes (severe, 16 cases; intermediate, 4 cases; mild, 3 cases). We found two common mutations that together accounted for 32% of the 44 unrelated alleles in these patients. One is the T312S mutation, a novel mutation found exclusively in milder patients. The other is the previously described I113F that produces a severe phenotype. The I113F and T312S mutations accounted for 8 (18%) and 6 (14%) of 44 unrelated alleles, respectively. The relatively high residual GALNS activity seen when the T312S mutant cDNA is overexpressed in mutant cells provides an explanation for the mild phenotype in patients with this mutation. The distribution and relative frequencies of the I113F and T312S mutations in Australia corresponded to those observed in Northern Ireland and are unique to these two populations, suggesting that both mutations were probably introduced to Australia by Irish migrants during the 19th century. Haplotype analysis using 6 RFLPs provides additional data that the I113F mutation originated from a common ancestor. The other 9 novel mutations identified in these 23 patients were each limited to a single family.

Previous findings in Caucasian populations of a DM founder chromosome raise a question about the molecular events involved in the expansion mutation. To investigate whether a founder chromosome for the DM mutation exists in the Japanese population, we genotyped families using polymorphic markers near the (CTG) n repeat region and constructed haplotypes.

In addition, we found seven individuals with hypohaptoglobinemia in three families, and the genotypes of six of the seven individuals were found to be Hp2/Hpdel.

By protein-truncation test (PTT) assay, the entire coding region of the APC gene was screened in affected individuals from 11 AAPC kindreds, and their phenotypic differences were examined. Five novel germ-line APC mutations were identified in seven kindreds.

Variability in the number of colorectal adenomas was most apparent in individuals with mutations in region 1, and upper-gastrointestinal manifestations were more severe in them. In individuals with mutations in either region 2 or region 3, the average number of adenomas tended to be lower than those in individuals with mutations in region 1, although age at diagnosis was similar. In all AAPC kindreds, a predominance of right-sided colorectal adenomas and rectal polyp sparing was observed. No desmoid tumors were found in these kindreds.

There is increasing evidence that there exist germ-line variants of the APC gene that predispose to the development of multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinoma, but without the florid phenotype of classical FAP, and possibly with importance for colorectal cancer risk in the general population.. \n", {"entities": [[4, 7, "GENE"], [336, 339, "GENE"], [474, 477, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [865, 868, "GENE"], [1126, 1129, "GENE"], [1296, 1299, "GENE"], [1502, 1505, "GENE"], [154, 157, "GENE"], [359, 362, "GENE"], [638, 641, "GENE"], [1639, 1642, "GENE"], [4, 7, "GENE"], [336, 339, "GENE"], [474, 477, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [865, 868, "GENE"], [1126, 1129, "GENE"], [1296, 1299, "GENE"], [1502, 1505, "GENE"], [154, 157, "GENE"], [359, 362, "GENE"], [638, 641, "GENE"], [1639, 1642, "GENE"], [4, 7, "GENE"], [336, 339, "GENE"], [474, 477, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [865, 868, "GENE"], [1126, 1129, "GENE"], [1296, 1299, "GENE"], [1502, 1505, "GENE"], [154, 157, "GENE"], [359, 362, "GENE"], [638, 641, "GENE"], [1639, 1642, "GENE"], [4, 7, "GENE"], [336, 339, "GENE"], [474, 477, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [865, 868, "GENE"], [1126, 1129, "GENE"], [1296, 1299, "GENE"], [1502, 1505, "GENE"], [4, 7, "GENE"], [336, 339, "GENE"], [474, 477, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [865, 868, "GENE"], [1126, 1129, "GENE"], [1296, 1299, "GENE"], [1502, 1505, "GENE"], [4, 7, "GENE"], [336, 339, "GENE"], [474, 477, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [865, 868, "GENE"], [1126, 1129, "GENE"], [1296, 1299, "GENE"], [1502, 1505, "GENE"], [4, 7, "GENE"], [336, 339, "GENE"], [474, 477, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [865, 868, "GENE"], [1126, 1129, "GENE"], [1296, 1299, "GENE"], [1502, 1505, "GENE"], [4, 7, "GENE"], [336, 339, "GENE"], [474, 477, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [865, 868, "GENE"], [1126, 1129, "GENE"], [1296, 1299, "GENE"], [1502, 1505, "GENE"], [154, 157, "GENE"], [359, 362, "GENE"], [638, 641, "GENE"], [1639, 1642, "GENE"], [4, 7, "DISEASE"], [55, 72, "DISEASE"], [122, 152, "DISEASE"], [154, 157, "DISEASE"], [180, 206, "DISEASE"], [252, 285, "DISEASE"], [336, 339, "DISEASE"], [359, 362, "DISEASE"], [366, 403, "DISEASE"], [474, 477, "DISEASE"], [484, 521, "DISEASE"], [549, 568, "DISEASE"], [638, 641, "DISEASE"], [683, 691, "DISEASE"], [716, 719, "DISEASE"], [865, 868, "DISEASE"], [926, 943, "DISEASE"], [964, 972, "DISEASE"], [1041, 1077, "DISEASE"], [1126, 1129, "DISEASE"], [1392, 1428, "DISEASE"], [1502, 1505, "DISEASE"], [1558, 1591, "DISEASE"], [1639, 1642, "DISEASE"], [1677, 1694, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The hemochromatosis 845 G-->A and 187 C-->G mutations: prevalence in non-Caucasian populations.\nHemochromatosis, the inherited disorder of iron metabolism, leads, if untreated, to progressive iron overload and premature death.

Neither vWf nor vWf propolypeptide (von Willebrand antigen II) were detectable in plasma, platelets, or endothelial cells of the homozygous mutant mice. The mutant mice exhibited defects in hemostasis with a highly prolonged bleeding time and spontaneous bleeding events in approximately 10% of neonates. As in the human disease, the factor VIII level in these mice was reduced strongly as a result of the lack of protection provided by vWf. Defective thrombosis in mutant mice was also evident in an in vivo model of vascular injury. In this model, the exteriorized mesentery was superfused with ferric chloride and the accumulation of fluorescently labeled platelets was observed by intravital microscopy.

VHL-negative 786-0 RCC cells are tumorigenic in nude mice which is suppressed by the reintroduction of VHL. Remarkably, this occurs without affecting the growth rate and cell cycle profile of these cells in culture. The 786-0 cell line, like many cancer cells, fails to exit the cell cycle upon serum withdrawal. Here, it is shown that reintroduction of the wild-type VHL gene restores the ability of VHL-negative RCC cancer cells to exit the cell cycle and enter G0/quiescence in low serum. Both VHL-positive and VHL-negative RCC cells exit the cell cycle by contact inhibition. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27, accumulates upon serum withdrawal, only in the presence of VHL, as a result of the stabilization of the protein. We propose that the loss of wild-type VHL gene results in a specific cellular defect in serum-dependent growth control, which may initiate tumor formation. This is corrected by the reintroduction of wild-type VHL, implicating VHL as the first tumor suppressor involved in the regulation of cell cycle exit, which is consistent with its gatekeeper function in the kidney.. \n", {"entities": [[142, 145, "GENE"], [215, 218, "GENE"], [324, 327, "GENE"], [427, 430, "GENE"], [692, 695, "GENE"], [725, 728, "GENE"], [821, 824, "GENE"], [838, 841, "GENE"], [1007, 1010, "GENE"], [1099, 1102, "GENE"], [1270, 1273, "GENE"], [1287, 1290, "GENE"], [142, 145, "GENE"], [215, 218, "GENE"], [324, 327, "GENE"], [427, 430, "GENE"], [692, 695, "GENE"], [725, 728, "GENE"], [821, 824, "GENE"], [838, 841, "GENE"], [1007, 1010, "GENE"], [1099, 1102, "GENE"], [1270, 1273, "GENE"], [1287, 1290, "GENE"], [142, 145, "GENE"], [215, 218, "GENE"], [324, 327, "GENE"], [427, 430, "GENE"], [692, 695, "GENE"], [725, 728, "GENE"], [821, 824, "GENE"], [838, 841, "GENE"], [1007, 1010, "GENE"], [1099, 1102, "GENE"], [1270, 1273, "GENE"], [1287, 1290, "GENE"], [142, 145, "GENE"], [215, 218, "GENE"], [324, 327, "GENE"], [427, 430, "GENE"], [692, 695, "GENE"], [725, 728, "GENE"], [821, 824, "GENE"], [838, 841, "GENE"], [1007, 1010, "GENE"], [1099, 1102, "GENE"], [1270, 1273, "GENE"], [1287, 1290, "GENE"], [142, 145, "GENE"], [215, 218, "GENE"], [324, 327, "GENE"], [427, 430, "GENE"], [692, 695, "GENE"], [725, 728, "GENE"], [821, 824, "GENE"], [838, 841, "GENE"], [1007, 1010, "GENE"], [1099, 1102, "GENE"], [1270, 1273, "GENE"], [1287, 1290, "GENE"], [142, 145, "GENE"], [215, 218, "GENE"], [324, 327, "GENE"], [427, 430, "GENE"], [692, 695, "GENE"], [725, 728, "GENE"], [821, 824, "GENE"], [838, 841, "GENE"], [1007, 1010, "GENE"], [1099, 1102, "GENE"], [1270, 1273, "GENE"], [1287, 1290, "GENE"], [142, 145, "GENE"], [215, 218, "GENE"], [324, 327, "GENE"], [427, 430, "GENE"], [692, 695, "GENE"], [725, 728, "GENE"], [821, 824, "GENE"], [838, 841, "GENE"], [1007, 1010, "GENE"], [1099, 1102, "GENE"], [1270, 1273, "GENE"], [1287, 1290, "GENE"], [142, 145, "GENE"], [215, 218, "GENE"], [324, 327, "GENE"], [427, 430, "GENE"], [692, 695, "GENE"], [725, 728, "GENE"], [821, 824, "GENE"], [838, 841, "GENE"], [1007, 1010, "GENE"], [1099, 1102, "GENE"], [1270, 1273, "GENE"], [1287, 1290, "GENE"], [4, 27, "DISEASE"], [123, 152, "DISEASE"], [215, 234, "DISEASE"], [258, 288, "DISEASE"], [290, 293, "DISEASE"], [299, 322, "DISEASE"], [343, 346, "DISEASE"], [427, 430, "DISEASE"], [571, 577, "DISEASE"], [692, 695, "DISEASE"], [738, 748, "DISEASE"], [851, 854, "DISEASE"], [1007, 1010, "DISEASE"], [1099, 1102, "DISEASE"], [1200, 1205, "DISEASE"], [1270, 1273, "DISEASE"], [1287, 1290, "DISEASE"], [1304, 1309, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Nonsense mutation in exon 4 of human complement C9 gene is the major cause of Japanese complement C9 deficiency.\nDeficiency of the ninth component of human complement (C9) is the most common complement deficiency in Japan but is rare in other countries.

Although the biochemical properties of BRCA1 polypeptides are not understood, their expression pattern and subcellular localization suggest a role in cell-cycle regulation. When resting cells are induced to proliferate, the steady-state levels of BRCA1 increase in late G1 and reach a maximum during S phase. Moreover, in S phase cells, BRCA1 polypeptides are hyperphosphorylated and accumulate into discrete subnuclear foci termed \" BRCA1 nuclear dots. \" BRCA1 associates in vivo with a structurally related protein termed BARD1. Here we show that the steady-state levels of BARD1, unlike those of BRCA1, remain relatively constant during cell cycle progression. However, immunostaining revealed that BARD1 resides within BRCA1 nuclear dots during S phase of the cell cycle, but not during the G1 phase. Nevertheless, BARD1 polypeptides are found exclusively in the nuclear fractions of both G1- and S-phase cells. Therefore, progression to S phase is accompanied by the aggregation of nuclear BARD1 polypeptides into BRCA1 nuclear dots. This cell cycle-dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 indicates a role for BARD1 in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. \n", {"entities": [[39, 44, "GENE"], [783, 788, "GENE"], [835, 840, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1078, 1083, "GENE"], [1254, 1259, "GENE"], [1342, 1347, "GENE"], [1379, 1384, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [783, 788, "GENE"], [835, 840, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1078, 1083, "GENE"], [1254, 1259, "GENE"], [1342, 1347, "GENE"], [1379, 1384, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [783, 788, "GENE"], [835, 840, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1078, 1083, "GENE"], [1254, 1259, "GENE"], [1342, 1347, "GENE"], [1379, 1384, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [783, 788, "GENE"], [835, 840, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1078, 1083, "GENE"], [1254, 1259, "GENE"], [1342, 1347, "GENE"], [1379, 1384, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [783, 788, "GENE"], [835, 840, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1078, 1083, "GENE"], [1254, 1259, "GENE"], [1342, 1347, "GENE"], [1379, 1384, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [783, 788, "GENE"], [835, 840, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1078, 1083, "GENE"], [1254, 1259, "GENE"], [1342, 1347, "GENE"], [1379, 1384, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [783, 788, "GENE"], [835, 840, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1078, 1083, "GENE"], [1254, 1259, "GENE"], [1342, 1347, "GENE"], [1379, 1384, "GENE"], [49, 54, "GENE"], [120, 125, "GENE"], [298, 303, "GENE"], [506, 511, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [693, 698, "GENE"], [715, 720, "GENE"], [858, 863, "GENE"], [982, 987, "GENE"], [1278, 1283, "GENE"], [1352, 1357, "GENE"], [1388, 1393, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [783, 788, "GENE"], [835, 840, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1078, 1083, "GENE"], [1254, 1259, "GENE"], [1342, 1347, "GENE"], [1379, 1384, "GENE"], [163, 188, "DISEASE"], [241, 246, "DISEASE"], [1403, 1408, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Genetic basis and molecular mechanism for idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.\nVentricular fibrillation causes more than 300, 000 sudden deaths each year in the USA alone.

Because of the small size of most pedigrees and the high incidence of sudden death, however, molecular genetic studies of IVF have not yet been done. Because IVF causes cardiac rhythm disturbance, we investigated whether malfunction of ion channels could cause the disorder by studying mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A. We have now identified a missense mutation, a splice-donor mutation, and a frameshift mutation in the coding region of SCN5A in three IVF families. We show that sodium channels with the missense mutation recover from inactivation more rapidly than normal and that the frameshift mutation causes the sodium channel to be non-functional.

We assessed the I1307K prevalence in Israeli Jews of differing ethnic origin and risk for colorectal cancer. METHODS  DNA samples from 500 unrelated Jews of European or non-European origin, with or without a personal and/or family history of neoplasia, were examined for the I1307K variant by the allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) method. RESULTS  In persons at average risk for colorectal cancer, I1307K was found in 5. 0% of 120 European and 1. 6% of 188 non-European Jews (P = 0. 08). It occurred in 15. 4% of 52 Ashkenazi Israelis with familial cancer (P = 0. 02) and was not detected in 51 non-European Jews at increased cancer risk. Colorectal neoplasia occurred personally or in the families of 13 of 20 Ashkenazi I1307K carriers, 8 of whom also had a personal or family history of noncolonic neoplasia.

METHODS  Twins with AS were identified from the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases database. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed to establish diagnoses, and disease severity was assessed using a combination of validated scoring systems. HLA typing for HLA-B27, HLA-B60, and HLA-DR1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers, and zygosity was assessed using microsatellite markers. Genetic and environmental variance components were assessed with the program Mx, using data from this and previous studies of twins with AS. RESULTS  Six of 8 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs were disease concordant, compared with 4 of 15 B27-positive dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (27%) and 4 of 32 DZ twin pairs overall (12. 5%). Nonsignificant increases in similarity with regard to age at disease onset and all of the disease severity scores assessed were noted in disease-concordant MZ twins compared with concordant DZ twins. HLA-B27 and B60 were associated with the disease in probands, and the rate of disease concordance was significantly increased among DZ twin pairs in which the co-twin was positive for both B27 and DR1. Additive genetic effects were estimated to contribute 97% of the population variance. CONCLUSION  Susceptibility to AS is largely genetically determined, and the environmental trigger for the disease is probably ubiquitous. HLA-B27 accounts for a minority of the overall genetic susceptibility to AS. \n", {"entities": [[70, 73, "GENE"], [495, 498, "GENE"], [510, 513, "GENE"], [519, 522, "GENE"], [532, 535, "GENE"], [1194, 1197, "GENE"], [1620, 1623, "GENE"], [70, 73, "GENE"], [495, 498, "GENE"], [510, 513, "GENE"], [519, 522, "GENE"], [532, 535, "GENE"], [1194, 1197, "GENE"], [1620, 1623, "GENE"], [536, 539, "GENE"], [1391, 1394, "GENE"], [18, 40, "DISEASE"], [199, 221, "DISEASE"], [223, 225, "DISEASE"], [248, 250, "DISEASE"], [304, 322, "DISEASE"], [808, 810, "DISEASE"], [1512, 1514, "DISEASE"], [1693, 1695, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The APCI1307K allele and cancer risk in a community-based study of Ashkenazi Jews.\nMutations in APC are classically associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple intestinal polyps and, without surgical intervention, the development of colorectal cancer (CRC).

The gene product, a member of the major histocompatibility complex class I-like family, was found to have a mutation, Cys-282 -- > Tyr (C282Y), in 85% of patient chromosomes. This mutation eliminates the ability of HFE to associate with beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) and prevents cell-surface expression. A second mutation that has no effect on beta2m association, H63D, was found in eight out of nine patients heterozygous for the C282Y mutant. In this report, we demonstrate in cultured 293 cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant HFE proteins that both the wild-type and H63D HFE proteins form stable complexes with the transferrin receptor (TfR). The C282Y mutation nearly completely prevents the association of the mutant HFE protein with the TfR. Studies on cell-associated transferrin at 37 degrees C suggest that the overexpressed wild-type HFE protein decreases the affinity of the TfR for transferrin. The overexpressed H63D protein does not have this effect, providing the first direct evidence for a functional consequence of the H63D mutation. Addition of soluble wild-type HFE/beta2m heterodimers to cultured cells also decreased the apparent affinity of the TfR for its ligand under steady-state conditions, both in 293 cells and in HeLa cells. Furthermore, at 4 degrees C, the added soluble complex of HFE/beta2m inhibited binding of transferrin to HeLa cell TfR in a concentration-dependent manner. Scatchard plots of these data indicate that the added heterodimer substantially reduced the affinity of TfR for transferrin. These results establish a molecular link between HFE and a key protein involved in iron transport, the TfR, and raise the possibility that alterations in this regulatory mechanism may play a role in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis.. \n", {"entities": [[219, 222, "GENE"], [439, 442, "GENE"], [757, 760, "GENE"], [803, 806, "GENE"], [951, 954, "GENE"], [1073, 1076, "GENE"], [1311, 1314, "GENE"], [1542, 1545, "GENE"], [1814, 1817, "GENE"], [355, 358, "GENE"], [219, 222, "GENE"], [439, 442, "GENE"], [757, 760, "GENE"], [803, 806, "GENE"], [951, 954, "GENE"], [1073, 1076, "GENE"], [1311, 1314, "GENE"], [1542, 1545, "GENE"], [1814, 1817, "GENE"], [219, 222, "GENE"], [439, 442, "GENE"], [757, 760, "GENE"], [803, 806, "GENE"], [951, 954, "GENE"], [1073, 1076, "GENE"], [1311, 1314, "GENE"], [1542, 1545, "GENE"], [1814, 1817, "GENE"], [219, 222, "GENE"], [439, 442, "GENE"], [757, 760, "GENE"], [803, 806, "GENE"], [951, 954, "GENE"], [1073, 1076, "GENE"], [1311, 1314, "GENE"], [1542, 1545, "GENE"], [1814, 1817, "GENE"], [219, 222, "GENE"], [439, 442, "GENE"], [757, 760, "GENE"], [803, 806, "GENE"], [951, 954, "GENE"], [1073, 1076, "GENE"], [1311, 1314, "GENE"], [1542, 1545, "GENE"], [1814, 1817, "GENE"], [219, 222, "GENE"], [439, 442, "GENE"], [757, 760, "GENE"], [803, 806, "GENE"], [951, 954, "GENE"], [1073, 1076, "GENE"], [1311, 1314, "GENE"], [1542, 1545, "GENE"], [1814, 1817, "GENE"], [219, 222, "GENE"], [439, 442, "GENE"], [757, 760, "GENE"], [803, 806, "GENE"], [951, 954, "GENE"], [1073, 1076, "GENE"], [1311, 1314, "GENE"], [1542, 1545, "GENE"], [1814, 1817, "GENE"], [4, 19, "DISEASE"], [185, 211, "DISEASE"], [1984, 2010, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Cycloheximide facilitates the identification of aberrant transcripts resulting from a novel splice-site mutation in COL17A1 in a patient with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa.\nPatients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa often show decreased expression of type XVII collagen, a transmembrane hemidesmosomal protein encoded by COL17A1. This report documents a novel splice-site mutation in COL17A1 in a patient with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa, and applies a new methodology to define and characterize the resulting mRNA splice variants. Mutational analysis of COL17A1 identified a maternally inherited G-to-T transversion at the -1 position of exon 32. This acceptor splice-site mutation led to the formation of aberrant transcripts present at extremely low levels. Based on our recent finding that cycloheximide stabilized mutant COL17A1 transcripts in keratinocytes homozygous for a frameshift mutation, the effects of the splice-site mutation on splicing of COL17A1 transcripts were determined using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of total RNA from keratinocytes incubated for 2. 5 h in the presence or absence of 10 microg cycloheximide per ml. Using this approach, an abnormally spliced transcript was identified that contains an extra 264 bases upstream from exon 32, resulting in a premature termination codon 27 bp downstream from the cryptic splice site. Three other splice variants, including one derived from the skipping of exon 32, were also identified. These results indicate the usefulness of cycloheximide treatment in evaluating the abnormal processing of mRNA due to splice-site mutations, because  (i) aberrant splicing often generates a premature termination codon, (ii) transcripts with premature termination codons can occur at low or undetectable levels due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and (iii) the levels of these transcripts can be increased by cycloheximide. \n", {"entities": [[116, 123, "GENE"], [362, 369, "GENE"], [425, 432, "GENE"], [618, 625, "GENE"], [889, 896, "GENE"], [1019, 1026, "GENE"], [116, 123, "GENE"], [362, 369, "GENE"], [425, 432, "GENE"], [618, 625, "GENE"], [889, 896, "GENE"], [1019, 1026, "GENE"], [116, 123, "GENE"], [362, 369, "GENE"], [425, 432, "GENE"], [618, 625, "GENE"], [889, 896, "GENE"], [1019, 1026, "GENE"], [116, 123, "GENE"], [362, 369, "GENE"], [425, 432, "GENE"], [618, 625, "GENE"], [889, 896, "GENE"], [1019, 1026, "GENE"], [116, 123, "GENE"], [362, 369, "GENE"], [425, 432, "GENE"], [618, 625, "GENE"], [889, 896, "GENE"], [1019, 1026, "GENE"], [116, 123, "GENE"], [362, 369, "GENE"], [425, 432, "GENE"], [618, 625, "GENE"], [889, 896, "GENE"], [1019, 1026, "GENE"], [154, 191, "DISEASE"], [219, 256, "DISEASE"], [463, 500, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The DMPK gene of severely affected myotonic dystrophy patients is hypermethylated proximal to the largely expanded CTG repeat.\nUsing methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, we characterized the methylation pattern on the 5 side of the CTG repeat in the DMPK gene of normal individuals and of patients affected with myotonic dystrophy, showing expansions of the repetitive sequence.

Although increasing measured allele size between patients clearly correlates with an increased severity of symptoms and an earlier age of onset, this correlation is not precise and measured allele length cannot be used as an accurate predictor of age of onset. In order to further characterize the dynamics of DM CTG repeat somatic instability, we have studied repeat length changes over time in 111 myotonic dystrophy patients with varying clinical severity and CTG repeat size over time intervals of 1-7 years. We have found a direct progression of the size heterogeneity over time related to initial CTG repeat size and the time interval and always biased towards further expansion. Attempts to mathematically model the dynamics have proved only partially successful suggesting that individual specific genetic and/or environmental factors also play a role in somatic mosaicism.. \n", {"entities": [[77, 95, "DISEASE"], [127, 145, "DISEASE"], [147, 149, "DISEASE"], [215, 217, "DISEASE"], [293, 295, "DISEASE"], [963, 965, "DISEASE"], [1053, 1071, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Inherited colorectal polyposis and cancer risk of the APC I1307K polymorphism.\nGerm-line and somatic truncating mutations of the APC gene are thought to initiate colorectal tumor formation in familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis, respectively. Recently, an isoleucine-- > lysine polymorphism at codon 1307 (I1307K) of the APC gene has been identified in 6% -7% of the Ashkenazi Jewish population. To assess the risk of this common APC allelic variant in colorectal carcinogenesis, we have analyzed a large cohort of unselected Ashkenazi Jewish subjects with adenomatous polyps and. or colorectal cancer, for the APC I1307K polymorphism. The APC I1307K allele was identified in 48 (10. 1%) of 476 patients. Compared with the frequency in two separate population control groups, the APC I1307K allele is associated with an estimated relative risk of 1. 5-1. 7 for colorectal neoplasia (both P =. 01). Furthermore, compared with noncarriers, APC I1307K carriers had increased numbers of adenomas and colorectal cancers per patient (P =. 03), as well as a younger age at diagnosis. We conclude that the APC I1307K variant leads to increased adenoma formation and directly contributes to 3% -4% of all Ashkenazi Jewish colorectal cancer. The estimated relative risk for carriers may justify specific clinical screening for the 360, 000 Americans expected to harbor this allele, and genetic testing in the setting of long-term-outcome studies may impact significantly on colorectal cancer prevention in this population.\n", {"entities": [[54, 57, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [364, 367, "GENE"], [473, 476, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [683, 686, "GENE"], [823, 826, "GENE"], [981, 984, "GENE"], [1141, 1144, "GENE"], [54, 57, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [364, 367, "GENE"], [473, 476, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [683, 686, "GENE"], [823, 826, "GENE"], [981, 984, "GENE"], [1141, 1144, "GENE"], [54, 57, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [364, 367, "GENE"], [473, 476, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [683, 686, "GENE"], [823, 826, "GENE"], [981, 984, "GENE"], [1141, 1144, "GENE"], [54, 57, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [364, 367, "GENE"], [473, 476, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [683, 686, "GENE"], [823, 826, "GENE"], [981, 984, "GENE"], [1141, 1144, "GENE"], [54, 57, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [364, 367, "GENE"], [473, 476, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [683, 686, "GENE"], [823, 826, "GENE"], [981, 984, "GENE"], [1141, 1144, "GENE"], [54, 57, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [364, 367, "GENE"], [473, 476, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [683, 686, "GENE"], [823, 826, "GENE"], [981, 984, "GENE"], [1141, 1144, "GENE"], [54, 57, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [364, 367, "GENE"], [473, 476, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [683, 686, "GENE"], [823, 826, "GENE"], [981, 984, "GENE"], [1141, 1144, "GENE"], [54, 57, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [364, 367, "GENE"], [473, 476, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [683, 686, "GENE"], [823, 826, "GENE"], [981, 984, "GENE"], [1141, 1144, "GENE"], [54, 57, "GENE"], [129, 132, "GENE"], [364, 367, "GENE"], [473, 476, "GENE"], [654, 657, "GENE"], [683, 686, "GENE"], [823, 826, "GENE"], [981, 984, "GENE"], [1141, 1144, "GENE"], [0, 30, "DISEASE"], [35, 41, "DISEASE"], [129, 132, "DISEASE"], [162, 178, "DISEASE"], [192, 231, "DISEASE"], [364, 367, "DISEASE"], [473, 476, "DISEASE"], [600, 618, "DISEASE"], [627, 645, "DISEASE"], [904, 924, "DISEASE"], [1026, 1034, "DISEASE"], [1039, 1057, "DISEASE"], [1179, 1186, "DISEASE"], [1256, 1273, "DISEASE"], [1507, 1524, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Human MLH1 deficiency predisposes to hematological malignancy and neurofibromatosis type 1.\nHeterozygous germ-line mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes lead to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.

I. Clinical, immunochemical, and family studies.\nThe first recognized human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement (C5) is described. The proband, a 20-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus since age 11, lacked serum hemolytic complement activity, even during remission. C5 was undetectable in her serum by both immunodiffusion and hemolytic assays. Other complement components were normal during remission of lupus, but C1, C4, C2, and C3 levels fell during exacerbations. A younger half-sister, who had no underlying disease, was also found to lack immunochemically detectable C5. By hemolytic assay, she exhibited 1-2% of the normal serum C5 level and normal concentrations of other complement components. C5 levels of other family members were either normal or approximately half-normal, consistent with autosomal codominant inheritance of the gene determining C5 deficiency. Normal hemolytic titers were restored to both homozygous C5-deficient (C5D) sera by addition of highly purified human C5. In specific C5 titrations, however, it was noted that when limited amounts of C5 were assayed in the presence of low dilutions of either C5D serum, curving rather than linear dose-response plots were consistently obtained, suggesting some inhibitory effect. Further studies suggested that low dilutions of C5D serum contain a factor (or factors) interfering at some step in the hemolytic assay of C5, rather than a true C5 inhibitor or inactivator. Of clinical interest are (a) the documentation of membranous glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and arthritis in an individual lacking C5 (and its biologic functions), and (b) a remarkable propensity to bacterial infections in the proband, even during periods of low-dose or alternate-day corticosteroid therapy. Other observations indicate that the C5D state is compatible with normal coagulation function and the capacity to mount a neutrophilic leukocytosis during pyogenic infection.. \n", {"entities": [[216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [547, 549, "GENE"], [555, 557, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [216, 218, "GENE"], [389, 391, "GENE"], [697, 699, "GENE"], [760, 762, "GENE"], [827, 829, "GENE"], [983, 985, "GENE"], [1055, 1057, "GENE"], [1116, 1118, "GENE"], [1132, 1134, "GENE"], [1198, 1200, "GENE"], [1517, 1519, "GENE"], [1540, 1542, "GENE"], [1701, 1703, "GENE"], [0, 58, "DISEASE"], [156, 214, "DISEASE"], [279, 307, "DISEASE"], [983, 996, "DISEASE"], [1055, 1067, "DISEASE"], [1069, 1072, "DISEASE"], [1257, 1260, "DISEASE"], [1426, 1429, "DISEASE"], [1630, 1648, "DISEASE"], [1650, 1660, "DISEASE"], [1666, 1675, "DISEASE"], [1769, 1789, "DISEASE"], [1916, 1919, "DISEASE"], [2034, 2052, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Detection of heterozygous carriers of the ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM) gene by G2 phase chromosomal radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes.\nIn ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients, mutations in a single gene, ATM, result in an autosomal recessive syndrome that embraces a variety of clinical features and manifests extreme radiosensitivity and a strong pre-disposition to malignancy.

The Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium.\nThe contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to inherited breast cancer was assessed by linkage and mutation analysis in 237 families, each with at least four cases of breast cancer, collected by the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium. Families were included without regard to the occurrence of ovarian or other cancers. Overall, disease was linked to BRCA1 in an estimated 52% of families, to BRCA2 in 32% of families, and to neither gene in 16% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6% -28%), suggesting other predisposition genes. The majority (81%) of the breast-ovarian cancer families were due to BRCA1, with most others (14%) due to BRCA2. Conversely, the majority of families with male and female breast cancer were due to BRCA2 (76%). The largest proportion (67%) of families due to other genes was found in families with four or five cases of female breast cancer only. These estimates were not substantially affected either by changing the assumed penetrance model for BRCA1 or by including or excluding BRCA1 mutation data. Among those families with disease due to BRCA1 that were tested by one of the standard screening methods, mutations were detected in the coding sequence or splice sites in an estimated 63% (95% CI 51% -77%). The estimated sensitivity was identical for direct sequencing and other techniques. The penetrance of BRCA2 was estimated by maximizing the LOD score in BRCA2-mutation families, over all possible penetrance functions. The estimated cumulative risk of breast cancer reached 28% (95% CI 9% -44%) by age 50 years and 84% (95% CI 43% -95%) by age 70 years. The corresponding ovarian cancer risks were 0. 4% (95% CI 0% -1%) by age 50 years and 27% (95% CI 0% -47%) by age 70 years. The lifetime risk of breast cancer appears similar to the risk in BRCA1 carriers, but there was some suggestion of a lower risk in BRCA2 carriers < 50 years of age. \n", {"entities": [[53, 58, "GENE"], [160, 165, "GENE"], [481, 486, "GENE"], [724, 729, "GENE"], [1101, 1106, "GENE"], [1136, 1141, "GENE"], [1198, 1203, "GENE"], [1908, 1913, "GENE"], [63, 68, "GENE"], [170, 175, "GENE"], [523, 528, "GENE"], [761, 766, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1467, 1472, "GENE"], [1518, 1523, "GENE"], [1973, 1978, "GENE"], [53, 58, "GENE"], [160, 165, "GENE"], [481, 486, "GENE"], [724, 729, "GENE"], [1101, 1106, "GENE"], [1136, 1141, "GENE"], [1198, 1203, "GENE"], [1908, 1913, "GENE"], [63, 68, "GENE"], [170, 175, "GENE"], [523, 528, "GENE"], [761, 766, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1467, 1472, "GENE"], [1518, 1523, "GENE"], [1973, 1978, "GENE"], [53, 58, "GENE"], [160, 165, "GENE"], [481, 486, "GENE"], [724, 729, "GENE"], [1101, 1106, "GENE"], [1136, 1141, "GENE"], [1198, 1203, "GENE"], [1908, 1913, "GENE"], [63, 68, "GENE"], [170, 175, "GENE"], [523, 528, "GENE"], [761, 766, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1467, 1472, "GENE"], [1518, 1523, "GENE"], [1973, 1978, "GENE"], [53, 58, "GENE"], [160, 165, "GENE"], [481, 486, "GENE"], [724, 729, "GENE"], [1101, 1106, "GENE"], [1136, 1141, "GENE"], [1198, 1203, "GENE"], [1908, 1913, "GENE"], [63, 68, "GENE"], [170, 175, "GENE"], [523, 528, "GENE"], [761, 766, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1467, 1472, "GENE"], [1518, 1523, "GENE"], [1973, 1978, "GENE"], [63, 68, "GENE"], [170, 175, "GENE"], [523, 528, "GENE"], [761, 766, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1467, 1472, "GENE"], [1518, 1523, "GENE"], [1973, 1978, "GENE"], [53, 58, "GENE"], [160, 165, "GENE"], [481, 486, "GENE"], [724, 729, "GENE"], [1101, 1106, "GENE"], [1136, 1141, "GENE"], [1198, 1203, "GENE"], [1908, 1913, "GENE"], [53, 58, "GENE"], [160, 165, "GENE"], [481, 486, "GENE"], [724, 729, "GENE"], [1101, 1106, "GENE"], [1136, 1141, "GENE"], [1198, 1203, "GENE"], [1908, 1913, "GENE"], [53, 58, "GENE"], [160, 165, "GENE"], [481, 486, "GENE"], [724, 729, "GENE"], [1101, 1106, "GENE"], [1136, 1141, "GENE"], [1198, 1203, "GENE"], [1908, 1913, "GENE"], [63, 68, "GENE"], [170, 175, "GENE"], [523, 528, "GENE"], [761, 766, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1467, 1472, "GENE"], [1518, 1523, "GENE"], [1973, 1978, "GENE"], [53, 58, "GENE"], [160, 165, "GENE"], [481, 486, "GENE"], [724, 729, "GENE"], [1101, 1106, "GENE"], [1136, 1141, "GENE"], [1198, 1203, "GENE"], [1908, 1913, "GENE"], [63, 68, "GENE"], [170, 175, "GENE"], [523, 528, "GENE"], [761, 766, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1467, 1472, "GENE"], [1518, 1523, "GENE"], [1973, 1978, "GENE"], [78, 91, "DISEASE"], [106, 119, "DISEASE"], [179, 202, "DISEASE"], [299, 312, "DISEASE"], [331, 344, "DISEASE"], [424, 448, "DISEASE"], [681, 702, "DISEASE"], [810, 839, "DISEASE"], [981, 994, "DISEASE"], [1616, 1629, "DISEASE"], [1736, 1750, "DISEASE"], [1863, 1876, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Severe early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation caused by POMC mutations in humans.\nSequential cleavage of the precursor protein pre-pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) generates the melanocortin peptides adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH) alpha, beta and gamma as well as the opioid-receptor ligand beta-endorphin. While a few cases of isolated ACTH deficiency have been reported (OMIM 201400), an inherited POMC defect has not been described so far. Recent studies in animal models elucidated a central role of alpha-MSH in the regulation of food intake by activation of the brain melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4-R; refs 3-5) and the linkage of human obesity to chromosome 2 in close proximity to the POMC locus, led to the proposal of an association of POMC with human obesity. The dual role of alpha-MSH in regulating food intake and influencing hair pigmentation predicts that the phenotype associated with a defect in POMC function would include obesity, alteration in pigmentation and ACTH deficiency. The observation of these symptoms in two probands prompted us to search for mutations within their POMC genes. Patient 1 was found to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in exon 3 (G7013T, C7133delta) which interfere with appropriate synthesis of ACTH and alpha-MSH. Patient 2 was homozygous for a mutation in exon 2 (C3804A) which abolishes POMC translation. These findings represent the first examples of a genetic defect within the POMC gene and define a new monogenic endocrine disorder resulting in early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation.. \n", {"entities": [[86, 90, "GENE"], [183, 187, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [752, 756, "GENE"], [805, 809, "GENE"], [973, 977, "GENE"], [1157, 1161, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1502, 1506, "GENE"], [86, 90, "GENE"], [183, 187, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [752, 756, "GENE"], [805, 809, "GENE"], [973, 977, "GENE"], [1157, 1161, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1502, 1506, "GENE"], [86, 90, "GENE"], [183, 187, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [752, 756, "GENE"], [805, 809, "GENE"], [973, 977, "GENE"], [1157, 1161, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1502, 1506, "GENE"], [86, 90, "GENE"], [183, 187, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [752, 756, "GENE"], [805, 809, "GENE"], [973, 977, "GENE"], [1157, 1161, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1502, 1506, "GENE"], [86, 90, "GENE"], [183, 187, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [752, 756, "GENE"], [805, 809, "GENE"], [973, 977, "GENE"], [1157, 1161, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1502, 1506, "GENE"], [86, 90, "GENE"], [183, 187, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [752, 756, "GENE"], [805, 809, "GENE"], [973, 977, "GENE"], [1157, 1161, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1502, 1506, "GENE"], [86, 90, "GENE"], [183, 187, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [752, 756, "GENE"], [805, 809, "GENE"], [973, 977, "GENE"], [1157, 1161, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1502, 1506, "GENE"], [86, 90, "GENE"], [183, 187, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [752, 756, "GENE"], [805, 809, "GENE"], [973, 977, "GENE"], [1157, 1161, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1502, 1506, "GENE"], [86, 90, "GENE"], [183, 187, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [752, 756, "GENE"], [805, 809, "GENE"], [973, 977, "GENE"], [1157, 1161, "GENE"], [1409, 1413, "GENE"], [1502, 1506, "GENE"], [19, 26, "DISEASE"], [28, 49, "DISEASE"], [398, 413, "DISEASE"], [702, 709, "DISEASE"], [821, 828, "DISEASE"], [1001, 1008, "DISEASE"], [1041, 1056, "DISEASE"], [1476, 1490, "DISEASE"], [1529, 1557, "DISEASE"], [1583, 1590, "DISEASE"], [1592, 1613, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The tumor suppressor gene Smad4/Dpc4 is required for gastrulation and later for anterior development of the mouse embryo.\nMutations in the SMAD4/DPC4 tumor suppressor gene, a key signal transducer in most TGFbeta-related pathways, are involved in 50% of pancreatic cancers.

The two other siblings, apparently healthy at 12 (1/2) and 15 years, respectively, and their father, apparently healthy as well, presented ARSA and GS values within the range of MLD patients. Mutation screening and sequence analysis disclosed the involvement of three different ARSA mutations being the molecular basis of intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity. The late infantile patient inherited from his mother the frequent 0-type mutation 459 + 1G > A, and from his father a novel, single basepair microdeletion of guanine at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 (7delG). The two clinically unaffected siblings carried the maternal mutation 459 + 1G > A and, on their paternal allele, a novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8, resulting in substitution of alanine 464 by valine (A464V). The fathers genotype thus was 7delG/A464V. Mutation A464V was not found in 18 unrelated MLD patients and 50 controls. A464V, although clearly modifying ARSA and GS levels, apparently bears little significance for clinical manifestation of MLD, mimicking the frequent ARSA pseudodeficiency allele. Our results demonstrate that in certain genetic conditions MLD-like ARSA and GS values need not be paralleled by clinical disease, a finding with serious diagnostic and prognostic implications. Moreover, further ARSA alleles functionally similar to A464V might exist which, together with 0-type mutations, may cause pathological ARSA and GS levels, but not clinical outbreak of the disease.. \n", {"entities": [[329, 333, "GENE"], [533, 537, "GENE"], [672, 676, "GENE"], [1353, 1357, "GENE"], [1468, 1472, "GENE"], [1566, 1570, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1827, 1831, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [533, 537, "GENE"], [672, 676, "GENE"], [1353, 1357, "GENE"], [1468, 1472, "GENE"], [1566, 1570, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1827, 1831, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [533, 537, "GENE"], [672, 676, "GENE"], [1353, 1357, "GENE"], [1468, 1472, "GENE"], [1566, 1570, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1827, 1831, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [533, 537, "GENE"], [672, 676, "GENE"], [1353, 1357, "GENE"], [1468, 1472, "GENE"], [1566, 1570, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1827, 1831, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [533, 537, "GENE"], [672, 676, "GENE"], [1353, 1357, "GENE"], [1468, 1472, "GENE"], [1566, 1570, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1827, 1831, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [533, 537, "GENE"], [672, 676, "GENE"], [1353, 1357, "GENE"], [1468, 1472, "GENE"], [1566, 1570, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1827, 1831, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [533, 537, "GENE"], [672, 676, "GENE"], [1353, 1357, "GENE"], [1468, 1472, "GENE"], [1566, 1570, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1827, 1831, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [533, 537, "GENE"], [672, 676, "GENE"], [1353, 1357, "GENE"], [1468, 1472, "GENE"], [1566, 1570, "GENE"], [1710, 1714, "GENE"], [1827, 1831, "GENE"], [92, 120, "DISEASE"], [239, 267, "DISEASE"], [269, 272, "DISEASE"], [572, 575, "DISEASE"], [1289, 1292, "DISEASE"], [1440, 1443, "DISEASE"], [1557, 1560, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Low levels of beta hexosaminidase A in healthy individuals with apparent deficiency of this enzyme.\nAppreciable beta hexosaminidase A (hex A) activity has been detected in cultured skin fibroblasts and melanoma tissue from healthy individuals previously reported as having deficiency of hex A activity indistinguishable from that of patients with Tay-Sachs disease (TSD).

Mice harbouring an intragenic deletion in Snrpn are phenotypically normal, suggesting that mutations of SNRPN are not sufficient to induce PWS. Mice with a larger deletion involving both Snrpn and the putative PWS-IC lack expression of the imprinted genes Zfp127 (mouse homologue of ZNF127), Ndn and Ipw, and manifest several phenotypes common to PWS infants. These data demonstrate that both the position of the IC and its role in the coordinate expression of genes is conserved between mouse and human, and indicate that the mouse is a suitable model system in which to investigate the molecular mechanisms of imprinting in this region of the genome.. \n", {"entities": [[190, 195, "GENE"], [449, 454, "GENE"], [511, 516, "GENE"], [594, 599, "GENE"], [190, 195, "GENE"], [449, 454, "GENE"], [511, 516, "GENE"], [594, 599, "GENE"], [190, 195, "GENE"], [449, 454, "GENE"], [511, 516, "GENE"], [594, 599, "GENE"], [190, 195, "GENE"], [449, 454, "GENE"], [511, 516, "GENE"], [594, 599, "GENE"], [699, 702, "GENE"], [18, 39, "DISEASE"], [283, 304, "DISEASE"], [306, 309, "DISEASE"], [373, 376, "DISEASE"], [546, 549, "DISEASE"], [754, 757, "DISEASE"]]}], ["A deletion mutation in COL17A1 in five Austrian families with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa represents propagation of an ancestral allele.\nPatients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa, a usually nonlethal form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, have generalized blistering, nail dystrophy, patchy alopecia, and dental abnormalities. Skin fragility in most cases is due to mutations in the gene encoding type XVII collagen (COL17A1). Recently, we reported five Austrian families with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa who share the same COL17A1 mutation. Affected individuals in three families are homozygous for 4003delTC, whereas those in two others are compound heterozygotes. To determine if the occurrence of 4003delTC in these unrelated families signifies propagation of an ancestral allele or a mutational hot spot, haplotypes were determined for polymorphisms both within and flanking COL17A1. Five intragenic polymorphisms were chosen based on their informativeness. One of these, not previously reported, was 2988 A or C that introduces a new restriction site for Eco0109 I. All the 4003delTC alleles showed the same haplotype for these five polymorphic markers. Fourteen microsatellite polymorphisms were selected based on their high heterozygosity and their location within 10q23-q25 near COL17A1. Three families shared microsatellite polymorphisms covering at most 19 cM, whereas the others shared smaller regions consistent with cross-over events during passage of this mutation through several generations. These results indicate that 4003delTC occurs on a single ancestral allele.. \n", {"entities": [[23, 30, "GENE"], [464, 471, "GENE"], [593, 600, "GENE"], [949, 956, "GENE"], [1357, 1364, "GENE"], [23, 30, "GENE"], [464, 471, "GENE"], [593, 600, "GENE"], [949, 956, "GENE"], [1357, 1364, "GENE"], [23, 30, "GENE"], [464, 471, "GENE"], [593, 600, "GENE"], [949, 956, "GENE"], [1357, 1364, "GENE"], [23, 30, "GENE"], [464, 471, "GENE"], [593, 600, "GENE"], [949, 956, "GENE"], [1357, 1364, "GENE"], [23, 30, "GENE"], [464, 471, "GENE"], [593, 600, "GENE"], [949, 956, "GENE"], [1357, 1364, "GENE"], [74, 111, "DISEASE"], [185, 222, "DISEASE"], [252, 284, "DISEASE"], [303, 313, "DISEASE"], [315, 329, "DISEASE"], [331, 346, "DISEASE"], [352, 372, "DISEASE"], [374, 388, "DISEASE"], [536, 573, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Identification of a novel mutation of the CPO gene in a Japanese hereditary coproporphyria family.\nHereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a deficiency of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) caused by a mutation in the CPO gene.

It is one member of a family of lamina-associated proteins which includes LAP1, LAP2 and lamin B receptor (LBR). A panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been mapped to six specific sites throughout the emerin molecule using phage-displayed peptide libraries and has been used to localize emerin in human and rabbit heart. Several mAbs against different emerin epitopes did not recognize intercalated discs in the heart, though they recognized cardiomyocyte nuclei strongly, both at the rim and in intranuclear spots or channels. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum against emerin did recognize both nuclear membrane and intercalated discs but, after affinity purification against a pure-emerin band on a western blot, it stained only the nuclear membrane. These results would not be expected if immunostaining at intercalated discs were due to a product of the emerin gene and, therefore, cast some doubt upon the hypothesis that cardiac defects in EDMD are caused by absence of emerin from intercalated discs. Although emerin was abundant in the membranes of cardiomyocyte nuclei, it was absent from many non-myocyte cells in the heart. This distribution of emerin was similar to that of lamin A, a candidate gene for an autosomal form of EDMD. In contrast, lamin B1 was absent from cardiomyocyte nuclei, showing that lamin B1 is not essential for localization of emerin to the nuclear lamina. Lamin B1 is also almost completely absent from skeletal muscle nuclei. In EDMD, the additional absence of lamin B1 from heart and skeletal muscle nuclei which already lack emerin may offer an alternative explanation of why these tissues are particularly affected.. \n", {"entities": [[322, 325, "GENE"], [68, 101, "DISEASE"], [173, 206, "DISEASE"], [208, 212, "DISEASE"], [1146, 1161, "DISEASE"], [1165, 1169, "DISEASE"], [1456, 1460, "DISEASE"], [1685, 1689, "DISEASE"]]}]]

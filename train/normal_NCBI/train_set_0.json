The results were in agreement with our hypothesis that ankylosing spondylitis is part of a syndrome where different genetic factors interact. Such known factors are HLA B27 associated disease susceptibility, susceptibility to psoriatic arthropathy and susceptibility to entero-arthropathy. Radiographical sacro-iliitis was restricted to HLA B27 positive relatives, and was more frequently found in relatives to probands with psoriasis than in relatives to probands without psoriasis. Environmental factors (intestinal bacteria) are known to trigger the disease at least in some persons, and we have postulated that all or most of them have the predisposition to develop disease. Thus, the syndrome has a multifactorial etiology. The phenotypic expressions of the different genetic predispositions involved, include sacro-iliitis, psoriasis, acute anterior uveitis, peripheral arthropathy and inflammatory bowel disease.

We now show that this dysmorphic C6 is bactericidally active and lacks an epitope that was mapped to the most carboxy-terminal part of C6 using C6 cDNA fragments expressed as fusion proteins in the pUEX expression system. We thus predicted that the abnormal C6 molecule might be carboxy-terminally truncated and sought a mutation in an area approximately 14% from the carboxy-terminal end of the coding sequence. By sequencing PCR-amplified products from this region, we found, in three individuals from two families, a mutation that might plausibly be responsible for the defect. All three have an abnormal 5 splice donor site of intron 15, which would probably prevent splicing. An in-frame stop codon is found 17 codons downstream from the intron boundary, which would lead to a truncated polypeptide 13. 5% smaller than normal C6. This result was unexpected, as earlier studies mapped the C5b binding site, or a putative enzymatic region, to this part of C6.

To elucidate the range of WASP mutations responsible for WAS, we used PCR-SSCP analysis to screen for WASP gene mutation in 19 unrelated boys with the diagnosis of classical or attenuated WAS or isolated thrombocytopenia. All 19 patients had WASP mutations, each of which localized to the initial three or terminal three exons of the gene, and the majority of which were unique in each case.

While the three mutations found in the isolated thrombocytopenia patients leave the reading frame intact, about one-half of the gene alterations detected in both severe and attenuated WAS patients result in frameshifted transcript and premature translation termination. These findings therefore confirm the association of WAS with WASP mutation and identify WASP mutation as a cause for isolated congenital thrombocytopenia in males. While the WASP gene defects responsible for isolated thrombocytopenia and other mild presentations of WAS do not appear distinct from those resulting in severe WAS, these data indicate that analysis of WASP gene mutation provides a valuable tool for distinguishing the spectrum of WAS patients and the subset of males with isolated thrombocytopenia who represent mild cases of WAS.. \n", {"entities": [[50, 74, "DISEASE"], [79, 104, "DISEASE"], [142, 145, "DISEASE"], [249, 263, "DISEASE"], [284, 317, "DISEASE"], [319, 322, "DISEASE"], [335, 359, "DISEASE"], [467, 470, "DISEASE"], [598, 601, "DISEASE"], [605, 630, "DISEASE"], [880, 883, "DISEASE"], [934, 937, "DISEASE"], [976, 992, "DISEASE"], [1039, 1064, "DISEASE"], [1184, 1187, "DISEASE"], [1322, 1325, "DISEASE"], [1396, 1423, "DISEASE"], [1478, 1503, "DISEASE"], [1536, 1539, "DISEASE"], [1594, 1597, "DISEASE"], [1715, 1718, "DISEASE"], [1757, 1782, "DISEASE"], [1811, 1814, "DISEASE"]]}], ["In this paper the employment of anti-LTs in allergic cutaneous diseases is analyzed showing that several studies have recently reported a beneficial effects of these agents (montelukast and zafirlukast as well as zileuton) for the treatment of some allergic cutaneous related diseases-like chronic urticaria and atopic eczema although their proper application remains to be established.", {"entities": [[298, 307, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Analyses with logistic and Cox proportional-hazards regressions, respectively.", {"entities": []}], ["However, whether the naturally occurring polymorphisms in the two GABA B receptor subunit genes interact with each other to alter susceptibility to nicotine dependence (ND) remains largely unknown.", {"entities": [[148, 167, "DISEASE"]]}], ["For a clear diagnosis, a laparoscopic abdominal mass resection was performed.", {"entities": []}], ["Linkage relationship of C2 deficiency, HLA and glyoxalase I loci.\nImmunogenetic analysis of a homozygous C2-deficient individual and family members demonstrated linkage of HLA-A25, B18 and C2o.

We previously reported evidence of linkage to the 1q24-25 region (HPC1) in 91 North American and Swedish families each with multiple cases of prostate cancer (Smith et al. 1996). In the present report we analyze 40 (12 original and 28 newly identified) Swedish families with hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) that, on the basis of 40 markers spanning a 25-cM interval within 1q24-25, have evidence of linkage. In the complete set of families, a maximum two-point LOD score of 1. 10 was observed at D1S413 (at a recombination fraction [theta] of. 1), with a maximum NPL (nonparametric linkage) Z score of 1. 64 at D1S202 (P =. 05). The evidence of linkage to this region originated almost exclusively from the subset of 12 early-onset (age < 65 years) families, which yielded a maximum LOD score of 2. 38 at D1S413 (straight theta = 0) and an NPL Z score of 1. 95 at D1S422 (P =. 03). Estimates from heterogeneity tests suggest that, within Sweden, as many as 50% of early-onset families had evidence of linkage to the HPC1 region.

We have overcome this problem by studying a cohort of patients from a single center where the diagnosis was confirmed at the genetic level. Twenty-eight index patients with protein S deficiency and a PROS1 gene defect were studied, together with 109 first-degree relatives. To avoid selection bias, we confined analysis of total and free protein S levels and thrombotic risk to the patients relatives. In this group of relatives, a low free protein S level was the most reliable predictor of a PROS1 gene defect (sensitivity 97. 7%, specificity 100%). First-degree relatives with a PROS1 gene defect had a 5. 0-fold higher risk of thrombosis (95% confidence interval, 1. 5-16. 8) than those with a normal PROS1 gene and no other recognized thrombophilic defect. Although pregnancy/puerperium and immobility/trauma were important precipitating factors for thrombosis, almost half of the events were spontaneous. Relatives with splice-site or major structural defects in the PROS1 gene were more likely to have had a thrombotic event and had significantly lower total and free protein S levels than those relatives having missense mutations.

Targeted deletion of Dm15, the mouse orthologue of human DMPK, produced mice with a mild myopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities, but without other features of myotonic dystrophy, such as myotonia and cataracts. We, and others, have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of the adjacent gene SIX5 (refs 7, 8), which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor. To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic dystrophy phenotype, we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a beta-galactosidase reporter. Six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in multiple tissues, including the developing lens. Homozygous mutant mice had no apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function, but developed lenticular opacities at a higher rate than controls.

Both probes identified an additional hybridizing fragment in the DNA from each patient, permitting the breakpoints in all three to be mapped within the cloned RB1 gene. Analysis of the breakpoint in one translocation cell line allowed the RB1 gene to be oriented with its 5 end toward the centromere. The 5 end of the gene also appeared to be associated with a clustering of sites for several infrequently cleaving restriction enzymes, indicating the presence of an HpaII tiny fragment island.

We investigated the metabolism of the HDL apolipoproteins (apo) apoA-I and apoA-II in a total of five patients with LCAT deficiency, one with classic LCAT deficiency and four with Fish-eye disease. Plasma levels of apoA-II were decreased to a proportionately greater extent (23% of normal) than apoA-I (30% of normal).

The metabolic basis for the low levels of apoA-II and LpA-I  A-II was investigated in all five patients using both exogenous radiotracer and endogenous stable isotope labeling techniques. The mean plasma residence time of apoA-I was decreased at 2. 08 +/- 0. 27 d (controls 4. 74 +/- 0. 65 days); however, the residence time of apoA-II was even shorter at 1. 66 +/- 0. 24 d (controls 5. 25 +/- 0. 61 d).

In summary, genetic syndromes of either complete or partial LCAT deficiency result in low levels of HDL through preferential hypercatabolism of apoA-II and HDL particles containing apoA-II. Because LpA-I has been proposed to be more protective than LpA-I  A-II against atherosclerosis, this selective effect on the metabolism of LpA-I  A-II may provide a potential explanation why patients with classic LCAT deficiency and Fish-eye disease are not at increased risk for premature atherosclerosis despite markedly decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and apoA-I \n", {"entities": [[254, 258, "GENE"], [301, 305, "GENE"], [625, 629, "GENE"], [659, 663, "GENE"], [1605, 1609, "GENE"], [1948, 1952, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [301, 305, "GENE"], [625, 629, "GENE"], [659, 663, "GENE"], [1605, 1609, "GENE"], [1948, 1952, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [301, 305, "GENE"], [625, 629, "GENE"], [659, 663, "GENE"], [1605, 1609, "GENE"], [1948, 1952, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [301, 305, "GENE"], [625, 629, "GENE"], [659, 663, "GENE"], [1605, 1609, "GENE"], [1948, 1952, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [301, 305, "GENE"], [625, 629, "GENE"], [659, 663, "GENE"], [1605, 1609, "GENE"], [1948, 1952, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [301, 305, "GENE"], [625, 629, "GENE"], [659, 663, "GENE"], [1605, 1609, "GENE"], [1948, 1952, "GENE"], [135, 173, "DISEASE"], [178, 194, "DISEASE"], [196, 270, "DISEASE"], [275, 291, "DISEASE"], [293, 316, "DISEASE"], [469, 507, "DISEASE"], [625, 640, "DISEASE"], [651, 674, "DISEASE"], [689, 705, "DISEASE"], [1585, 1620, "DISEASE"], [1814, 1829, "DISEASE"], [1940, 1963, "DISEASE"], [1968, 1984, "DISEASE"], [2025, 2040, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The sequences encoding human and fungal P 2 protein were subcloned, expressed in Escherichia coli as His 6 -tagged fusion proteins, and purified by Ni 2 proteins were recognized by IgE antibodies from allergic individuals sensitized to the A .", {"entities": []}], ["However, evidence is lacking regarding the level of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and the related factors to insufficient physical activity (IPA).", {"entities": []}], ["X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD): a novel mutation of the ALD gene in 6 members of a family presenting with 5 different phenotypes.\nFragments of the adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) cDNA from a patient with adolescent ALD were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned.

Many missense and protein-truncating mutations of the causative gene RS1 have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating. RS1 encodes a 224 amino acid protein, retinoschisin, which contains a discoidin domain but is of unknown function. We have generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from a unique region within retinoschisin, which detects a protein of approximately 28 kDa in retinal samples reduced with dithiothreitol, but multimers sized > 40 kDa under non-reducing conditions. A screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae. We investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both RS1 mRNA (using in situ hybridization with riboprobes) and retinoschisin (using immunohistochemistry). The antisense riboprobe detected RS1 mRNA only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina. Furthermore, differentiated retinoblastoma cells (Weri-Rb1 cells) were found to express RS1 mRNA and to release retinoschisin. These results suggest that retinoschisin is released by photo-receptors and has functions within the inner retinal layers.

Further molecular analysis revealed deletions involving the VHL gene in each of these families. In four families, partial deletions of one or more exons were detected by Southern blot analysis. In the fifth family, FISH analysis demonstrated the deletion of the entire VHL gene. Our results show that (quantitative) Southern blot analysis is a sensitive method for detecting germline deletions of the VHL gene and should be implemented in routine DNA diagnosis for VHL disease. Our data support the previously established observation that families with a germline deletion have a low risk for pheochromocytoma. Further unraveling of genotype-phenotype correlations in VHL disease has revealed that families with a full or partial deletion of the VHL gene exhibit a phenotype with a preponderance of central nervous system hemangioblastoma.. \n", {"entities": [[85, 88, "GENE"], [115, 118, "GENE"], [455, 458, "GENE"], [577, 580, "GENE"], [786, 789, "GENE"], [918, 921, "GENE"], [982, 985, "GENE"], [1185, 1188, "GENE"], [1263, 1266, "GENE"], [85, 88, "GENE"], [115, 118, "GENE"], [455, 458, "GENE"], [577, 580, "GENE"], [786, 789, "GENE"], [918, 921, "GENE"], [982, 985, "GENE"], [1185, 1188, "GENE"], [1263, 1266, "GENE"], [85, 88, "GENE"], [115, 118, "GENE"], [455, 458, "GENE"], [577, 580, "GENE"], [786, 789, "GENE"], [918, 921, "GENE"], [982, 985, "GENE"], [1185, 1188, "GENE"], [1263, 1266, "GENE"], [85, 88, "GENE"], [115, 118, "GENE"], [455, 458, "GENE"], [577, 580, "GENE"], [786, 789, "GENE"], [918, 921, "GENE"], [982, 985, "GENE"], [1185, 1188, "GENE"], [1263, 1266, "GENE"], [85, 88, "GENE"], [115, 118, "GENE"], [455, 458, "GENE"], [577, 580, "GENE"], [786, 789, "GENE"], [918, 921, "GENE"], [982, 985, "GENE"], [1185, 1188, "GENE"], [1263, 1266, "GENE"], [85, 88, "GENE"], [115, 118, "GENE"], [455, 458, "GENE"], [577, 580, "GENE"], [786, 789, "GENE"], [918, 921, "GENE"], [982, 985, "GENE"], [1185, 1188, "GENE"], [1263, 1266, "GENE"], [85, 88, "GENE"], [115, 118, "GENE"], [455, 458, "GENE"], [577, 580, "GENE"], [786, 789, "GENE"], [918, 921, "GENE"], [982, 985, "GENE"], [1185, 1188, "GENE"], [1263, 1266, "GENE"], [85, 88, "GENE"], [115, 118, "GENE"], [455, 458, "GENE"], [577, 580, "GENE"], [786, 789, "GENE"], [918, 921, "GENE"], [982, 985, "GENE"], [1185, 1188, "GENE"], [1263, 1266, "GENE"], [85, 88, "GENE"], [115, 118, "GENE"], [455, 458, "GENE"], [577, 580, "GENE"], [786, 789, "GENE"], [918, 921, "GENE"], [982, 985, "GENE"], [1185, 1188, "GENE"], [1263, 1266, "GENE"], [66, 83, "DISEASE"], [85, 88, "DISEASE"], [96, 127, "DISEASE"], [133, 158, "DISEASE"], [195, 239, "DISEASE"], [282, 298, "DISEASE"], [300, 320, "DISEASE"], [326, 371, "DISEASE"], [455, 458, "DISEASE"], [577, 580, "DISEASE"], [786, 789, "DISEASE"], [918, 921, "DISEASE"], [982, 993, "DISEASE"], [1110, 1126, "DISEASE"], [1185, 1196, "DISEASE"], [1263, 1266, "DISEASE"], [1316, 1355, "DISEASE"]]}], ["These results demonstrate that aquaglyceroporins differ both in selectivity for and in transport rates of trivalent arsenicals.", {"entities": []}], ["Asthma outcomes were assessed cross-sectionally in 2216 children at age 8 on the basis of parents\u2019 responses to the ISAAC questionnaire whilst skin prick tests to eleven aeroallergens were also performed in a subgroup of 746 children.", {"entities": [[0, 6, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Deletion of the KIT and PDGFRA genes in a patient with piebaldism.\nWe have previously shown that human piebaldism results from mutations of the KIT gene, which encodes the receptor for the mast/stem cell growth factor and is located in chromosome segment 4q12.

Attempts to define the clinical significance of BRCA mutation status in ovarian cancer have produced conflicting results, especially regarding survival. OBJECTIVE  To determine whether hereditary ovarian cancers have distinct clinical and pathological features compared with sporadic (nonhereditary) ovarian cancers. DESIGN AND SETTING  Retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of 933 ovarian cancers diagnosed and treated at our institution, which is a comprehensive cancer center as designated by the National Cancer Institute, over a 12-year period (December 1986 to August 1998). PATIENTS  The study was restricted to patients of Jewish origin because of the ease of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotyping in this ethnic group. From the 189 patients who identified themselves as Jewish, 88 hereditary cases were identified with the presence of a germline founder mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The remaining 101 cases from the same series not associated with a BRCA mutation and 2 additional groups (Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 52 and 111) with ovarian cancer from clinical trials (for the survival analysis) were included for comparison. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  Age at diagnosis, surgical stage, histologic cell type and grade, and surgical outcome; and response to chemotherapy and survival for advanced-stage (II and IV) cases. RESULTS  Hereditary cancers were rarely diagnosed before age 40 years and were common after age 60 years, with mean age at diagnosis being significantly younger for BRCA1- vs BRCA2-linked patients (54 vs 62 years; P =. 04). Histology, grade, stage, and success of cytoreductive surgery were similar for hereditary and sporadic cases. The hereditary group had a longer disease-free interval following primary chemotherapy in comparison with the nonhereditary group, with a median time to recurrence of 14 months and 7 months, respectively (P <. 001). Those with hereditary cancers had improved survival compared with the nonhereditary group (P =. 004). For stage III cancers, BRCA mutation status was an independent prognostic variable (P =. 03). CONCLUSIONS  Although BRCA-associated hereditary ovarian cancers in this population have surgical and pathological characteristics similar to those of sporadic cancers, advanced-stage hereditary cancer patients survive longer than nonhereditary cancer patients. Age penetrance is greater for BRCA1-linked than for BRCA2-linked cancers in this population.\n", {"entities": [[154, 159, "GENE"], [851, 856, "GENE"], [1047, 1052, "GENE"], [1673, 1678, "GENE"], [2546, 2551, "GENE"], [163, 168, "GENE"], [861, 866, "GENE"], [1056, 1061, "GENE"], [1683, 1688, "GENE"], [2568, 2573, "GENE"], [154, 159, "GENE"], [851, 856, "GENE"], [1047, 1052, "GENE"], [1673, 1678, "GENE"], [2546, 2551, "GENE"], [163, 168, "GENE"], [861, 866, "GENE"], [1056, 1061, "GENE"], [1683, 1688, "GENE"], [2568, 2573, "GENE"], [154, 159, "GENE"], [851, 856, "GENE"], [1047, 1052, "GENE"], [1673, 1678, "GENE"], [2546, 2551, "GENE"], [163, 168, "GENE"], [861, 866, "GENE"], [1056, 1061, "GENE"], [1683, 1688, "GENE"], [2568, 2573, "GENE"], [30, 69, "DISEASE"], [85, 111, "DISEASE"], [242, 256, "DISEASE"], [355, 381, "DISEASE"], [445, 485, "DISEASE"], [565, 580, "DISEASE"], [648, 654, "DISEASE"], [692, 698, "DISEASE"], [1223, 1237, "DISEASE"], [1517, 1535, "DISEASE"], [2069, 2087, "DISEASE"], [2164, 2181, "DISEASE"], [2276, 2318, "DISEASE"], [2405, 2421, "DISEASE"], [2423, 2455, "DISEASE"], [2485, 2505, "DISEASE"], [2546, 2588, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The FP6 EU HENVINET project aimed at synthesizing the scientific information available on a number of topics of high relevance to policy makers in environment and health.", {"entities": []}], ["H-89, a PKA-specific inhibitor, could significantly inhibit ORMDL3 expression.", {"entities": [[60, 66, "GENE"]]}], ["Moreover, we classify the predicted DDIs as Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme-Dependent and CYP-Independent interactions invoking their locations on the Growing Self Organizing Map, due to the particular importance of these enzymes in clinically significant interaction effects.", {"entities": []}], ["Coats' disease of the retina (unilateral retinal telangiectasis) caused by somatic mutation in the NDP gene: a role for norrin in retinal angiogenesis.\nCoats disease is characterized by abnormal retinal vascular development (so-called retinal telangiectasis) which results in massive intraretinal and subretinal lipid accumulation (exudative retinal detachment).

This supports recent observations that the protein is critical for normal retinal vasculogenesis. \n", {"entities": [[99, 102, "GENE"], [604, 607, "GENE"], [775, 778, "GENE"], [910, 913, "GENE"], [987, 990, "GENE"], [99, 102, "GENE"], [604, 607, "GENE"], [775, 778, "GENE"], [910, 913, "GENE"], [987, 990, "GENE"], [99, 102, "GENE"], [604, 607, "GENE"], [775, 778, "GENE"], [910, 913, "GENE"], [987, 990, "GENE"], [99, 102, "GENE"], [604, 607, "GENE"], [775, 778, "GENE"], [910, 913, "GENE"], [987, 990, "GENE"], [99, 102, "GENE"], [604, 607, "GENE"], [775, 778, "GENE"], [910, 913, "GENE"], [987, 990, "GENE"], [0, 14, "DISEASE"], [30, 63, "DISEASE"], [152, 165, "DISEASE"], [186, 223, "DISEASE"], [235, 257, "DISEASE"], [284, 330, "DISEASE"], [332, 360, "DISEASE"], [385, 398, "DISEASE"], [498, 511, "DISEASE"], [544, 558, "DISEASE"], [715, 728, "DISEASE"], [849, 869, "DISEASE"], [938, 958, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Mitochondria contain their own DNA (MtDNA) that is very sensitive to oxidative stress and as a consequence could be damaged in quantity.", {"entities": []}], ["The models predicted 60% of the variance in 2-week F inf , with an RMSE of 0.13.", {"entities": []}], ["Adverse events were reported by a similar percentage of patients receiving glycopyrronium (40.4%) and tiotropium (40.6%).", {"entities": []}], ["All spice extracts, with the exception of turmeric, enhanced the growth of Bifidobacterium spp.", {"entities": []}], ["The purpose of this study was to analyze the trend of medical utilization and costs on a long-term basis.", {"entities": []}], ["A 4-megabase YAC contig that spans the Langer-Giedion syndrome region on human chromosome 8q24.1: use in refining the location of the trichorhinophalangeal syndrome and multiple exostoses genes (TRPS1 and EXT1).\nWe have constructed a physical map covering over 4 Mb of human chromosome 8q24. 1 and used this map to refine the locations of the genes responsible for Langer-Giedion syndrome.

We determined the (CTG) n repeat lengths in a broad range of tissue DNAs from patients with mild, classical, or congenital manifestation of DM. Differences in the repeat length were seen in somatic tissues from single DM individuals and twins. Repeats appeared to expand to a similar extent in tissues originating from the same embryonal origin. In most male patients carrying intermediate- or small-sized expansions in blood, the repeat lengths covered a markedly wider range in sperm. In contrast, male patients with large allele expansions in blood (> 700 CTGs) had similar or smaller repeats in sperm, when detectable. Sperm alleles with > 1, 000 CTGs were not seen. We conclude that DM patients can be considered gonosomal mosaics, i. e e., combined somatic and germ-line tissue mosaics. Most remarkably, we observed multiple cases where the length distributions of intermediate- or small-sized alleles in fathers sperm were significantly different from that in their offsprings blood. Our combined findings indicate that intergenerational length changes in the unstable CTG repeat are most likely to occur during early embryonic mitotic divisions in both somatic and germ-line tissue formation.

Recently, a gene responsible for this disease, designated XLRS1, was identified, and several deleterious gene mutations were reported. OBJECTIVE  To analyze Japanese patients clinically diagnosed as having XLRS formutational changes in the XLRS1 gene. METHODS  Ten patients with XLRS underwent full ophthalmologic examination, including slitlamp biomicroscopy and dilated funduscopy. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes, and all exons of the XLRS1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed using a direct sequencing method. RESULTS  Point mutations in the XLRS1 gene were identified in all 10 patients. The mutations were identical in each of 2 pairs of brothers. Six of the point mutations represented missense mutations, 1 was a nonsense mutation, and 1 was a frameshift mutation. Five of the mutations are newly reported herein. CONCLUSIONS  The discovery of new point mutations in this study increases the available information regarding the spectrum of genetic abnormalities and clinical manifestations of XLRS. However, the limited data failed to reveal a correlation between mutation and disease phenotype. CLINICAL RELEVANCE  Identification of mutations in the XLRS1 gene and expanded information on clinical manifestations will facilitate early diagnosis, appropriate early therapy, and genetic counseling regarding the prognosis of XLRS.. \n", {"entities": [[0, 22, "DISEASE"], [75, 97, "DISEASE"], [99, 103, "DISEASE"], [126, 149, "DISEASE"], [162, 173, "DISEASE"], [394, 398, "DISEASE"], [467, 471, "DISEASE"], [1171, 1192, "DISEASE"], [1224, 1228, "DISEASE"], [1555, 1559, "DISEASE"]]}], ["From this analysis it comes out that bacterial lysates have a protective effect, which induce a significant reduction of the symptoms related to respiratory infections.", {"entities": []}], ["CD23 mediates numerous immune responses by enhancing IgE-specific antigen presentation, regulating IgE synthesis, influencing cell differentiation and growth of both B- and T-cells.", {"entities": []}], ["A 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene results in a kinetic variant of phenylketonuria.\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease due to deficiency of a hepatic enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).

We report here a 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the PAH gene (delta 194) in a mild variant, with markedly reduced affinity of the enzyme for phenylalanine (Km = 160 nM), and we provide functional evidence for responsibility of the deletion in the mutant phenotype. Since the deletion was located in the third exon of the gene, which presents no homology with other hydroxylases, we suggest that exon 3 is involved in the specificity of the enzyme for phenylalanine.

The frequency and genetic basis of G6PD deficiency have been studied in Africa, around the Mediterranean, and in the Far East, but little such information is available about the situation in India. To determine the extent of heterogeneity of G6PD, we have studied several different Indian populations by screening for G6PD deficiency, followed by molecular analysis of deficient alleles. The frequency of G6PD deficiency varies between 3% and 15% in different tribal and urban groups. Remarkably, a previously unreported deficient variant, G6PD Orissa (44 Ala-- > Gly), is responsible for most of the G6PD deficiency in tribal Indian populations but is not found in urban populations, where most of the G6PD deficiency is due to the G6PD Mediterranean (188 Ser-- > Phe) variant.

Most patients have a heterozygous mutation in the APT1 gene, which encodes Fas (CD95, APO-1), mediator of an apoptotic pathway crucial to lymphocyte homeostasis. Of 17 unique APT1 mutations in unrelated ALPS probands, 12 (71%) occurred in exons 7-9, which encode the intracellular portion of Fas. In vitro, activated lymphocytes from all 17 patients showed apoptotic defects when exposed to an anti-Fas agonist monoclonal antibody. Similar defects were found in a Fas-negative cell line transfected with cDNAs bearing each of the mutations. In cotransfection experiments, Fas constructs with either intra- or extracellular mutations caused dominant inhibition of apoptosis mediated by wild-type Fas. Two missense Fas variants, not restricted to patients with ALPS, were identified. Variant A (-1) T at the Fas signal-sequence cleavage site, which mediates apoptosis less well than wild-type Fas and is partially inhibitory, was present in 13% of African American alleles. Among the ALPS-associated Fas mutants, dominant inhibition of apoptosis was much more pronounced in mutants affecting the intracellular, versus extracellular, portion of the Fas receptor. Mutations causing disruption of the intracellular Fas death domain also showed a higher penetrance of ALPS phenotype features in mutation-bearing relatives. Significant ALPS-related morbidity occurred in 44% of relatives with intracellular mutations, versus 0% of relatives with extracellular mutations.

The time course and magnitude of increased [3H] thymidine incorporation by T lymphocytes in response to L10 mAb paralleled that induced by anti-CD3 mAb. Effective stimulation was dependent on the presence of monocytes and the Fc portion of L10 mAb. Stimulation of lymphocytes by L10, like stimulation by anti-CD3 mAb, involves increased expression of 4F2, HLA-DR, and IL-2-R. These observations suggest that sialophorin functions in T cell activation.. \n", {"entities": [[447, 450, "GENE"], [58, 82, "DISEASE"], [323, 373, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy: molecular pathology in two siblings.\nWe report on a new allele at the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) locus causing late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).

It has been particularly difficult to rationalize the dominant inheritance with the fact that the expansion mutation lies outside of the protein-encoding gene elements, and should not be translated into protein. Here we use muscle biopsies from classical adult-onset myotonic dystrophy patients to study the accumulation of transcripts from both the normal and expanded DM kinase genes in patient muscle, and compare the results to normal and myopathic controls. We found relatively small decreases of DM kinase RNA in the total RNA pool from muscle; however, these reductions were not disease specific. Analysis of poly (A) + RNA showed dramatic decreases of both the mutant and normal DM kinase RNAs, and these changes were disease-specific. Our findings are consistent with a novel molecular pathogenetic mechanism for myotonic dystrophy  both the normal and expanded DM kinase genes are transcribed in patient muscle, but the abnormal expansion-containing RNA has a dominant effect on RNA metabolism by preventing the accumulation of poly (A) + RNA.

The complex is necessary for the stabilization of the discs, which are renewed constantly throughout life, and which contain the visual pigments necessary for photon capture. Mutations in Prph2 have been shown to result in a variety of photoreceptor dystrophies, including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and macular dystrophy. A common feature of these diseases is the loss of photoreceptor function, also seen in the retinal degeneration slow (rds or Prph2 Rd2/Rd2) mouse, which is homozygous for a null mutation in Prph2. It is characterized by a complete failure to develop photoreceptor discs and outer segments, downregulation of rhodopsin and apoptotic loss of photoreceptor cells. The electroretinograms (ERGs) of Prph2Rd2/Rd2 mice have greatly diminished a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, which decline to virtually undetectable concentrations by two months. Subretinal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding a Prph2 transgene results in stable generation of outer segment structures and formation of new stacks of discs containing both perpherin-2 and rhodopsin, which in many cases are morphologically similar to normal outer segments. Moreover, the re-establishment of the structural integrity of the photoreceptor layer also results in electrophysiological correction.

Recently the FMF gene (MEFV) was cloned; the protein product, pyrin/marenostrin, is thought to regulate inflammation in myeloid cells. In this manuscript we report the mouse and rat homologs of MEFV. The murine gene contains ten exons with a coding sequence of 2304 bp, while the rat homolog has nine exons with a coding sequence of 2253 bp. A considerable amino acid sequence homology was observed between the mouse and human (47. 6% identity and 65. 5% similarity) and between the mouse and rat genes (73. 5% identity and 82. 1% similarity). The predicted rodent proteins have several important domains and signals found in human pyrin, including a B-box zinc finger domain, Robbins-Dingwall nuclear localization signal, and coiled-coil domain. However, perhaps because of an ancient frame-shift mutation, neither the mouse nor the rat protein has an intact C-terminal B30. 2 domain, in which most FMF-associated mutations have been found in human MEFV. Nevertheless, like the human gene, mouse Mefv is expressed in peripheral blood granulocytes but not lymphocytes. Consistent with its expression in granulocytes, Mefv was detected at high levels in the primary follicles and marginal zones of the splenic white pulp. Mefv is localized on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 16, region A3-B1, extending a region of synteny with human Chr 16p13. 3.

The NBS1 protein is specifically mutated in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome and forms a complex with the DNA repair proteins Rad50 and Mrel1. Here we show that phosphorylation of NBS1, induced by ionizing radiation, requires catalytically active ATM. Complexes containing ATM and NBS1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells treated with ionizing radiation. We have identified two residues of NBS1, Ser 278 and Ser 343 that are phosphorylated in vitro by ATM and whose modification in vivo is essential for the cellular response to DNA damage. This response includes S-phase checkpoint activation, formation of the NBS1/Mrel1/Rad50 nuclear foci and rescue of hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Together, these results demonstrate a biochemical link between cell-cycle checkpoints activated by DNA damage and DNA repair in two genetic diseases with overlapping phenotypes.. \n", {"entities": [[316, 319, "GENE"], [690, 693, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [907, 910, "GENE"], [569, 574, "GENE"], [1078, 1083, "GENE"], [316, 319, "GENE"], [690, 693, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [907, 910, "GENE"], [316, 319, "GENE"], [690, 693, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [907, 910, "GENE"], [316, 319, "GENE"], [690, 693, "GENE"], [716, 719, "GENE"], [907, 910, "GENE"], [24, 45, "DISEASE"], [50, 76, "DISEASE"], [92, 113, "DISEASE"], [115, 118, "DISEASE"], [124, 150, "DISEASE"], [152, 155, "DISEASE"], [161, 188, "DISEASE"], [212, 218, "DISEASE"], [300, 303, "DISEASE"], [493, 519, "DISEASE"], [1111, 1149, "DISEASE"], [1283, 1299, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Loss of the ataxia-telangiectasia gene product causes oxidative damage in target organs.\nAtaxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by a markedly increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, increased incidence of cancer, and neurodegeneration, especially of the cerebellar Purkinje cells.

The genetic defect is a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene, consisting of 15 exons. Using a transgenic DMPK-overexpressor mouse model, we demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse DMPK gene and the human DMPK transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mRNAs which have almost identical cell type-dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns. Use of a cryptic 5 splice site in exon 8, which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides specifying a VSGGG peptide motif, and/or use of a cryptic 3 splice site in exon 14, which leads to a frameshift in the mRNA reading frame, occur as independent stochastic events in all tissues examined.

We generated all six full-length mouse cDNAs that result from combinations of these three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kDa full-length (heart-, skeletal muscle- or brain-specific) and two C-terminally truncated approximately 68 kDa (smooth muscle-specific) isoforms.

Until relatively recently, there was no obvious mouse model of this genetic disease for the development of therapeutic strategies. The identification of a mouse X-linked mutant showing muscular dystrophy, mdx, has provided a candidate mouse genetic homologue to the DMD locus; the relatively mild pathological features of mdx suggest it may have more in common with mutations of the Becker muscular dystrophy type at the same human locus, however. But the close genetic linkage of mdx to G6PD and Hprt on the mouse X chromosome, coupled with its comparatively mild pathology, have suggested that the mdx mutation may instead correspond to Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which itself is closely linked to DNA markers at Xq28-qter in the region of G6PD on the human X chromosome. Using an interspecific mouse domesticus/spretus cross, segregating for a variety of markers on the mouse X chromosome, we have positioned on the mouse X chromosome sequences homologous to a DMD cDNA clone.

The PAX3/FKHR fusion gene, formed by a t (2; 13) (q35; q14) in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, encodes a hybrid protein that contains both PAX3 DNA binding domains, the paired box and homeodomain, linked to the bisected DNA binding domain of FKHR, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. Here we report that PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR display similar, but not identical transactivation activities when tested with model Pax recognition sequences. No functional role could be ascribed solely to the residual FKHR binding domain present in the fusion protein, but FKHR was found to contribute a strong carboxyl terminal activation domain replacing the one located in the unrearranged PAX3 gene. We show that the native PAX3/FKHR protein present in tumor cells with this translocation has transcriptional characteristics similar to the in vitro expressed protein. The ability of the PAX3/FKHR hybrid protein to bind DNA in a sequence specific manner and to transactivate the expression of artificial reporter genes suggests that its aberrant expression could subvert the transcriptional programs that normally control the growth, differentiation, and survival of primitive myogenic precursors in vivo.. \n", {"entities": [[30, 34, "GENE"], [283, 287, "GENE"], [413, 417, "GENE"], [600, 604, "GENE"], [609, 613, "GENE"], [966, 970, "GENE"], [1001, 1005, "GENE"], [1164, 1168, "GENE"], [30, 34, "GENE"], [283, 287, "GENE"], [413, 417, "GENE"], [600, 604, "GENE"], [609, 613, "GENE"], [966, 970, "GENE"], [1001, 1005, "GENE"], [1164, 1168, "GENE"], [30, 34, "GENE"], [283, 287, "GENE"], [413, 417, "GENE"], [600, 604, "GENE"], [609, 613, "GENE"], [966, 970, "GENE"], [1001, 1005, "GENE"], [1164, 1168, "GENE"], [4, 29, "DISEASE"], [265, 277, "DISEASE"], [342, 367, "DISEASE"], [1030, 1035, "DISEASE"]]}], ["However, technological problems resulted in poor video-streaming quality for some participants.", {"entities": []}], ["Asef, a link between the tumor suppressor APC and G-protein signaling.\nThe adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis and in sporadic colorectal tumors.

Although both PLS and HMS share the cardinal features of PPK and severe periodontitis, a number of additional findings are reported in HMS including arachnodactyly, acro-osteolysis, atrophic changes of the nails, and a radiographic deformity of the fingers. While PLS cases have been identified throughout the world, HMS has only been described among descendants of a religious isolate originally from Cochin, India. Parental consanguinity is a characteristic of many cases of both conditions. Although autosomal recessive transmission of PLS is evident, a more \" complex \" autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance with phenotypic influences from a closely linked modifying locus has been hypothesised for HMS. Recently, mutations of the cathepsin C gene have been identified as the underlying genetic defect in PLS. To determine if a cathepsin C mutation is also responsible for HMS, we sequenced the gene in affected and unaffected subjects from the Cochin isolate in which both the PLS and HMS phenotypes appear. Here we report identification of a mutation of cathepsin C (exon 6, 2127A-- > G) that changes a highly conserved amino acid in the cathepsin C peptide. This mutation segregates with HMS in four nuclear families. Additionally, the existence of a shared common haplotype for genetic loci flanking the cathepsin C gene suggests that affected subjects descended from the Cochin isolate are homozygous for a mutation inherited \" identical by descent \" from a common ancestor. This finding supports simple autosomal recessive inheritance for HMS in these families. We also report a mutation of the same exon 6 CTSC codon (2126C-- > T) in a Turkish family with classical PLS.

We recently identified the gene causing FMF, designated MEFV, and found it to be expressed in mature neutrophils, suggesting that it functions as an inflammatory regulator. To facilitate our understanding of the normal function of MEFV, we extended our previous studies. MEFV messenger RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow leukocytes, with differential expression observed among cells by in situ hybridization. CD34 hematopoietic stem-cell cultures induced toward the granulocytic lineage expressed MEFV at the myelocyte stage, concurrently with lineage commitment. The prepromyelocytic cell line HL60 expressed MEFV only at granulocytic and monocytic differentiation. MEFV was also expressed in the monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1. Among peripheral blood leukocytes, MEFV expression was detected in neutrophils, eosinophils, and to varying degrees, monocytes. Consistent with the tissue specificity of expression, complete sequencing and analysis of upstream regulatory regions of MEFV revealed homology to myeloid-specific promoters and to more broadly expressed inflammatory promoter elements. In vitro stimulation of monocytes with the proinflammatory agents interferon (IFN) gamma, tumor necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide induced MEFV expression, whereas the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor beta inhibited such expression.

In granulocytes, MEFV was up-regulated by IFN-gamma and the combination of IFN-alpha and colchicine.

Inherited G6PD deficiency is associated with either episodic hemolytic anemia (triggered by fava beans or other agents) or life-long hemolytic anemia. We show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene. From the alignment of the amino acid (aa) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) species from 42 different organisms, we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause G6PD deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of G6PD  two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved (50-99%) aa; relatively few are in fully conserved aa (where they might be lethal) or in poorly conserved aa, where presumably they simply would not cause G6PD deficiency. This is consistent with the notion that all human mutants have residual enzyme activity and that null mutations are lethal at some stage of development. Comparing the distribution of mutations in a human housekeeping gene with evolutionary conservation is a useful tool for pinpointing amino acid residues important for the stability or the function of the corresponding protein.

In contrast, cells from patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome were virtually completely unable to convert hypoxanthine to nucleotides.

All but two of these previously described mutations cause in-frame deletions in type II collagen, either by small deletions in the gene or splice site alterations. Furthermore, all but one of these mutations is located between exons 12 and 24 in the COL2A1 gene. We used heteroduplex analysis to identify sequence anomalies in five individuals with Kniest dysplasia. Sequencing of the index patients genomic DNA identified four new dominant mutations in COL2A1 that result in Kniest dysplasia  a 21-bp deletion in exon 16, an 18-bp deletion in exon 19, and 4-bp deletions in the splice donor sites of introns 14 and 20. A previously described 28-bp deletion at the COL2A1 exon 12-intron 12 junction, deleting the splice donor site, was identified in the fifth case. The latter three mutations are predicted to result in exon skipping in the mRNA encoded from the mutant allele.

The hyperalphalipoproteinemia caused by CETP deficiency is fairly common in Japan and one of the most common mutations in the CETP gene is the splicing defect of the intron 14, the allelic frequency of which has been shown to be 0. 0049 in the Japanese general population. Recently, we have reported a missense mutation in exon 15 of the CETP gene (442D  G), showing a dominant effect on the CETP activity and HDL-cholesterol level. In the current study, we determined the frequency of this new mutation in Japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic (HDL-cholesterol > or = 100 mg/dl) subjects. A rapid and easy screening method for this new mutation was developed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -mediated site-directed mutagenesis. Among 117 Japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic subjects (HDL-cholesterol; 116. 7 +/- 16. 5 mg/dl, mean +/- S. D.) without the intron 14 splice defect, three homozygotes (2. 5%) and 34 heterozygotes (29. 1%) were found to have the 442D  G mutation. The relative allelic frequency of this mutation was calculated to be 0. 17. One of the homozygotes for the 442D  G mutation was the patient previously described by us as having hyperalphalipoproteinemia with corneal opacity and coronary heart disease. This was the first reported subject homozygous for the CETP deficiency who also demonstrated atherosclerotic symptoms. In homozygous subjects, CETP activity ranged from 37% to 62% of the normal value, which was consistent with the results obtained from the transient expression experiment previously reported; however, the specific activity of CETP was not as low as expected.

Novel mutations were found in two of these families. The third is a previously reported mutation (G-- > A transition at nt 1444) (Nakano et al., 1988). Direct sequencing of PCR products identified a novel insertion of an A after nt 547 in family 1. This change generates an early termination codon 6 bp downstream from the insertion site. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirmed homozygosity in the proband. Single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of amplified exon 13 revealed a T-- > C transition at nt 1453 with the corresponding amino acid substitution W485R in the second family. This mutation creates an Fnu4HI restriction site. The proband is homozygous for this allele. When the site-specific mutagenized alpha cDNA carrying the T-- > C transition at nt 1453 was expressed in COS 1 cells hexosaminidase S activity was not detectable above background. A G-- > A transition at nt 1444 (exon 13) corresponding to the E482K substitution was found in the third family. This mutation occurs at a CpG dinucleotide. It has been reported in an Italian TSD proband and causes defective intracellular transport of the alpha-subunit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. \n", {"entities": [[6, 23, "DISEASE"], [105, 122, "DISEASE"], [124, 127, "DISEASE"], [1284, 1287, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Given the impact of exacerbations on health status and prognosis, it is crucial to target COPD patients for optimal treatment.", {"entities": []}], ["Mutations in the PAX6 gene in patients with hereditary aniridia.\nThe 14 exons of the PAX6 gene have been analysed exon-by-exon using SSCP in 6 aniridia families.

Two mutations involved C-- > T transitions in CGAarg codons in exons 9 and 11. Another C-- > T transition converted a CAG-glutamine to a TAG-stop in exon 7. Small insertions created frameshifts which produced downstream stop codons in another two patients and an A-- > T mutation disrupted the splice donor site of exon 5 in the remaining family. Thus, complete inactivation of the PAX6 gene is predicted in all cases.

A benefit of hypobetalipoproteinemia is that mildly affected individuals may be protected from coronary vascular disease. We have used gene targeting to generate mice with a modified Apob allele. Mice containing this allele display all of the hallmarks of human hypobetalipoproteinemia  they produce a truncated apoB protein, apoB70, and have markedly decreased plasma concentrations of apoB, beta-lipoproteins, and total cholesterol. In addition, the mice manifest several characteristics that are occasionally observed in human hypobetalipoproteinemia, including reduced plasma triglyceride concentrations, fasting chylomicronemia, and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol. An unexpected finding is that the modified Apob allele is strongly associated with exencephalus and hydrocephalus.

These data demonstrate that  1) there is an identical 2-base pair deletion in an exon of the C5 gene in several different C5-deficient mouse strains; 2) the mRNA transcribed from the C5D gene retains this deletion; and 3) this mutation should result in C5 protein deficiency.\n", {"entities": [[53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [53, 55, "GENE"], [156, 158, "GENE"], [344, 346, "GENE"], [490, 492, "GENE"], [686, 688, "GENE"], [722, 724, "GENE"], [918, 920, "GENE"], [1122, 1124, "GENE"], [1210, 1212, "GENE"], [1366, 1368, "GENE"], [1422, 1424, "GENE"], [1548, 1550, "GENE"], [1577, 1579, "GENE"], [1708, 1710, "GENE"], [0, 56, "DISEASE"], [156, 169, "DISEASE"], [330, 346, "DISEASE"], [490, 503, "DISEASE"], [686, 699, "DISEASE"], [1122, 1134, "DISEASE"], [1577, 1589, "DISEASE"], [1708, 1729, "DISEASE"]]}], ["22.4% (5039/22509) of child deaths were RTI-related.", {"entities": []}], ["Loss-of-function mutations in the cathepsin C gene result in periodontal disease and palmoplantar keratosis.\nPapillon-Lefevre syndrome, or keratosis palmoplantaris with periodontopathia (PLS, MIM 245000), is an autosomal recessive disorder that is mainly ascertained by dentists because of the severe periodontitis that afflicts patients. Both the deciduous and permanent dentitions are affected, resulting in premature tooth loss. Palmoplantar keratosis, varying from mild psoriasiform scaly skin to overt hyperkeratosis, typically develops within the first three years of life. Keratosis also affects other sites such as elbows and knees. Most PLS patients display both periodontitis and hyperkeratosis. Some patients have only palmoplantar keratosis or periodontitis, and in rare individuals the periodontitis is mild and of late onset. The PLS locus has been mapped to chromosome 11q14-q21 (refs 7, 8, 9). Using homozygosity mapping in eight small consanguineous families, we have narrowed the candidate region to a 1. 2-cM interval between D11S4082 and D11S931. The gene (CTSC) encoding the lysosomal protease cathepsin C (or dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I) lies within this interval. We defined the genomic structure of CTSC and found mutations in all eight families.

Only 25% of patients studied with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease have exonic mutations in this gene, the underlying cause of the disease in the remaining patients is unknown. The PLP gene encodes two major alternatively spliced transcripts called PLP and DM20. PLP messenger RNA is specifically expressed in central nervous system tissue, whereas DM20 messenger RNA is found in central nervous system, cardiac, and other tissues. We studied cultured skin fibroblasts from 2 brothers with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease who exhibited no detectable exonic mutation of the PLP gene. Examination of RNA from these cells showed that the level of DM20 messenger RNA is elevated sixfold relative to male control skin fibroblasts. An unrelated female carrier, also with no detectable exonic mutation, showed a threefold increase in DM20 messenger RNA in cultured skin fibroblasts. Our findings suggest that in some patients, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is caused by overexpression of PLP gene transcripts, and that in these families a 50% increase of DM20 messenger RNA in females, relative to the increase in affected males, can identify a female carrier.. \n", {"entities": [[58, 86, "DISEASE"], [88, 116, "DISEASE"], [122, 202, "DISEASE"], [323, 351, "DISEASE"], [775, 803, "DISEASE"], [1202, 1230, "DISEASE"]]}], ["These structures were identical to those of the R-LPS from B. melitensis EP, a strain simultaneously expressing both smooth and R-LPS, also studied herein.", {"entities": []}], ["Furthermore, subcutaneous homografts models showed the increased tumor growth and tumor vascularization with the CCL18 stimulation, and the expression of Ki67, PCNA, and CD31 in CCL18 stimulation mice was also significantly increased.", {"entities": [[113, 118, "GENE"], [178, 183, "GENE"], [160, 164, "GENE"], [113, 118, "GENE"], [178, 183, "GENE"]]}], ["Incidence and characteristics of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants in Japan.\nA total of 3000 men living in Yamaguchi were screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using Beutlers spot test and three types of starch gel electrophoresis.

Neither immunohistochemical studies nor molecular genetic analyses of the VHL gene have been reported previously for this lesion. The authors describe two cases of clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis, both of which were initially confused with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Both lesions showed positive immunohistochemical staining for low and intermediate molecular weight keratins (Cam 5. 2 and AE1/AE3), EMA, vimentin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. Each was negative for CEA. Because clear cell papillary cystadenoma is similar to renal cell carcinoma histologically, and because both occur as components of the von Hippel-Lindau disease complex, the authors analyzed both cases for the presence of mutations in the VHL gene. A somatic VHL gene mutation was detected in one of the two tumors by polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Direct sequencing revealed a cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide 694, resulting in the replacement of an arginine with a stop codon after the sixth amino acid of exon 3.

The study group consisted of 66 Polish families with cancer who have at least three related females affected with breast or ovarian cancer and who had cancer diagnosed, in at least one of the three affected females, at age < 50 years. A total of 26 families had both breast and ovarian cancers, 4 families had ovarian cancers only, and 36 families had breast cancers only. Genomic DNA was prepared from the peripheral blood leukocytes of at least one affected woman from each family. The entire coding region of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was screened for the presence of germline mutations, by use of SSCP followed by direct sequencing of observed variants. Mutations were found in 35 (53%) of the 66 families studied. All but one of the mutations were detected within the BRCA1 gene.

We aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer. METHODS  We examined genomic DNA from 83 (for BRCA1 185delAG) or 82 (for BRCA2 6174delT) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients, most of whom were treated at a relatively young age, for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the Ashkenazi population. RESULTS  Our study should have been able to detect a 4-5-fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2. However, only one (1. 15%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3. 6%) of the patients was heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele, and only two were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation (2. 4%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6. 2%). CONCLUSIONS  The incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence (about 1%) in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population. This suggests that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers, mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer \n", {"entities": [[20, 25, "GENE"], [222, 227, "GENE"], [376, 381, "GENE"], [498, 503, "GENE"], [843, 848, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1337, 1342, "GENE"], [30, 35, "GENE"], [231, 236, "GENE"], [385, 390, "GENE"], [525, 530, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1021, 1026, "GENE"], [1346, 1351, "GENE"], [20, 25, "GENE"], [222, 227, "GENE"], [376, 381, "GENE"], [498, 503, "GENE"], [843, 848, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1337, 1342, "GENE"], [30, 35, "GENE"], [231, 236, "GENE"], [385, 390, "GENE"], [525, 530, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1021, 1026, "GENE"], [1346, 1351, "GENE"], [20, 25, "GENE"], [222, 227, "GENE"], [376, 381, "GENE"], [498, 503, "GENE"], [843, 848, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1337, 1342, "GENE"], [30, 35, "GENE"], [231, 236, "GENE"], [385, 390, "GENE"], [525, 530, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1021, 1026, "GENE"], [1346, 1351, "GENE"], [20, 25, "GENE"], [222, 227, "GENE"], [376, 381, "GENE"], [498, 503, "GENE"], [843, 848, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1337, 1342, "GENE"], [30, 35, "GENE"], [231, 236, "GENE"], [385, 390, "GENE"], [525, 530, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1021, 1026, "GENE"], [1346, 1351, "GENE"], [20, 25, "GENE"], [222, 227, "GENE"], [376, 381, "GENE"], [498, 503, "GENE"], [843, 848, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1337, 1342, "GENE"], [30, 35, "GENE"], [231, 236, "GENE"], [385, 390, "GENE"], [525, 530, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1021, 1026, "GENE"], [1346, 1351, "GENE"], [20, 25, "GENE"], [222, 227, "GENE"], [376, 381, "GENE"], [498, 503, "GENE"], [843, 848, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1337, 1342, "GENE"], [30, 35, "GENE"], [231, 236, "GENE"], [385, 390, "GENE"], [525, 530, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1021, 1026, "GENE"], [1346, 1351, "GENE"], [20, 25, "GENE"], [222, 227, "GENE"], [376, 381, "GENE"], [498, 503, "GENE"], [843, 848, "GENE"], [961, 966, "GENE"], [1337, 1342, "GENE"], [30, 35, "GENE"], [231, 236, "GENE"], [385, 390, "GENE"], [525, 530, "GENE"], [852, 857, "GENE"], [1021, 1026, "GENE"], [1346, 1351, "GENE"], [63, 78, "DISEASE"], [140, 164, "DISEASE"], [275, 290, "DISEASE"], [435, 450, "DISEASE"], [558, 573, "DISEASE"], [808, 823, "DISEASE"], [1149, 1164, "DISEASE"], [1296, 1322, "DISEASE"], [1391, 1406, "DISEASE"]]}], ["We have developed an integrative, cell-based modeling approach to facilitate the design and discovery of chemical agents directed to specific sites of action within a living organism.", {"entities": []}], ["Policymakers in low- and middle-income countries, where tobacco control as a child health issue is relatively neglected, should integrate tobacco control measures with other child health promotion policies.", {"entities": []}], ["Synergistic effect of histone hyperacetylation and DNA demethylation in the reactivation of the FMR1 gene.\nMost fragile X syndrome patients have expansion of a (CGG) (n) sequence with > 200 repeats (full mutation) in the FMR1 gene responsible for this condition. Hypermethylation of the expanded repeat and of the FMR1 promoter is almost always present and apparently suppresses transcription, resulting in absence of the FMR1 protein. We recently showed that transcriptional reactivation of FMR1 full mutations can be achieved by inducing DNA demethylation with 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-azadC). The level of histone acetylation is another important factor in regulating gene expression; therefore, we treated lymphoblastoid cell lines of non-mosaic full mutation patients with three drugs capable of inducing histone hyperacetylation. We observed a consistent, although modest, reactivation of the FMR1 gene with 4-phenylbutyrate, sodium butyrate and trichostatin A, as shown by RT-PCR. However, we report that combining these drugs with 5-azadC results in a 2- to 5-fold increase in FMR1 mRNA levels obtained with 5-azadC alone, thus showing a marked synergistic effect of histone hyperacetylation and DNA demethylation in the reactivation of FMR1 full mutations.. \n", {"entities": [[96, 100, "GENE"], [221, 225, "GENE"], [314, 318, "GENE"], [422, 426, "GENE"], [492, 496, "GENE"], [896, 900, "GENE"], [1082, 1086, "GENE"], [1242, 1246, "GENE"], [96, 100, "GENE"], [221, 225, "GENE"], [314, 318, "GENE"], [422, 426, "GENE"], [492, 496, "GENE"], [896, 900, "GENE"], [1082, 1086, "GENE"], [1242, 1246, "GENE"], [96, 100, "GENE"], [221, 225, "GENE"], [314, 318, "GENE"], [422, 426, "GENE"], [492, 496, "GENE"], [896, 900, "GENE"], [1082, 1086, "GENE"], [1242, 1246, "GENE"], [96, 100, "GENE"], [221, 225, "GENE"], [314, 318, "GENE"], [422, 426, "GENE"], [492, 496, "GENE"], [896, 900, "GENE"], [1082, 1086, "GENE"], [1242, 1246, "GENE"], [96, 100, "GENE"], [221, 225, "GENE"], [314, 318, "GENE"], [422, 426, "GENE"], [492, 496, "GENE"], [896, 900, "GENE"], [1082, 1086, "GENE"], [1242, 1246, "GENE"], [96, 100, "GENE"], [221, 225, "GENE"], [314, 318, "GENE"], [422, 426, "GENE"], [492, 496, "GENE"], [896, 900, "GENE"], [1082, 1086, "GENE"], [1242, 1246, "GENE"], [96, 100, "GENE"], [221, 225, "GENE"], [314, 318, "GENE"], [422, 426, "GENE"], [492, 496, "GENE"], [896, 900, "GENE"], [1082, 1086, "GENE"], [1242, 1246, "GENE"], [96, 100, "GENE"], [221, 225, "GENE"], [314, 318, "GENE"], [422, 426, "GENE"], [492, 496, "GENE"], [896, 900, "GENE"], [1082, 1086, "GENE"], [1242, 1246, "GENE"], [112, 130, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Western publicly funded health care systems increasingly rely on interdisciplinary teams to support primary care delivery and management of chronic conditions.", {"entities": []}], ["Data on lifetime stress or worry about common life events/difficulties (i.e., romantic breakups, family disruption, interpersonal difficulties, and personal stress (health, weight, school work)), symptoms of depression, conduct disorder symptoms, and substance use were collected from 1025 grade 7 students (mean age 12.9 years; 45% male).", {"entities": [[220, 236, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Novel mutation at the initiation codon in the Norrie disease gene in two Japanese families.\nWe have identified a new mutation of Norrie disease (ND) gene in two Japanese males from unrelated families; they showed typical ocular features of ND but no mental retardation or hearing impairment.

Analyses of rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids, YAC contigs, and FISH of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences (the END repeats) at or near the breakpoints. The END-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene (HERC2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues. One of five PWS/AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable, rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event.

Additionally, a histogram analysis of platelet size revealed a single population of abnormally small platelets in the affected propositus, whereas the heterozygous mother had no appreciable small platelet subpopulation. In vitro culture of hemopoietic progenitor cells of the heterozygous mother showed that the majority of progenitor cells did not express the WAS allele. However, a small number of cells expressing the G-6-PD type linked with the WAS allele were detected. The proportion of the latter progenitors was significantly higher among more primitive progenitors (those giving rise to later appearing colonies).

By northern blot analysis we did not detect any expression of MAGEL2/Magel2 but by RT-PCR analysis, specific expression was detected in fetal and adult brain and in placenta. Both genes are intronless with tandem direct repeat sequences contained within a CpG island in the 5-untranscribed region.

Here we present data from non-Ashkenazi Jewish and Arab patients in whom we had not originally found mutations and from a new, more ethnically diverse panel. Among 90 symptomatic mutation-positive individuals, 11 mutations accounted for 79% of carrier chromosomes. Of the two mutations that are novel, one alters the same residue (680) as a previously known mutation, and the other (P369S) is located in exon 3. Consistent with another recent report, the E148Q mutation was observed in patients of several ethnicities and on multiple microsatellite haplotypes, but haplotype data indicate an ancestral relationships between non-Jewish Italian and Ashkenazi Jewish patients with FMF and other affected populations. Among approximately 200 anonymous Ashkenazi Jewish DNA samples, the MEFV carrier frequency was 21%, with E148Q the most common mutation. Several lines of evidence indicate reduced penetrance among Ashkenazi Jews, especially for E148Q, P369S, and K695R. Nevertheless, E148Q helps account for recessive inheritance in an Ashkenazi family previously reported as an unusual case of dominantly inherited FMF.

In view of this discrepancy, we examined the frequency of ATM germline mutations in a selected group of Dutch patients with breast cancer. We have analyzed ATM germline mutations in normal blood lymphocytes, using the protein-truncation test followed by genomic-sequence analysis. A high percentage of ATM germline mutations was demonstrated among patients with sporadic breast cancer. The 82 patients included in this study had developed breast cancer at age < 45 and had survived >/= 5 years (mean 15 years), and in 33 (40%) of the patients a contralateral breast tumor had been diagnosed.

Subsequent reports in additional collections of families have yielded conflicting results. In addition, evidence for locus heterogeneity has been provided by the identification of other putative hereditary prostate cancer loci on Xq27-28, 1q42-43, and 1p36. The present study describes a combined analysis for six markers in the 1q24-25 region in 772 families affected by hereditary prostate cancer and ascertained by the members of the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG) from North America, Australia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Overall, there was some evidence for linkage, with a peak parametric multipoint LOD score assuming heterogeneity (HLOD) of 1. 40 (P =. 01) at D1S212. The estimated proportion of families (alpha) linked to the locus was. 06 (1-LOD support interval. 01-. 12). This evidence was not observed by a nonparametric approach, presumably because of the extensive heterogeneity. Further parametric analysis revealed a significant effect of the presence of male-to-male disease transmission within the families. In the subset of 491 such families, the peak HLOD was 2. In the subset of 491 such families, the peak HLOD was 2. 56 (P =. 0006) and alpha =. 11 (1-LOD support interval. 04-. 19), compared with HLODs of 0 in the remaining 281 families.

Mutations in the human homolog of Foxc1, FKHL7, cause dominant anterior segment defects and glaucoma in various families.

These abnormalities include small or absent Schlemms canal, aberrantly developed trabecular meshwork, iris hypoplasia, severely eccentric pupils and displaced Schwalbes line. The penetrance of clinically obvious abnormalities varies with genetic background. In some affected eyes, collagen bundles were half normal diameter, or collagen and elastic tissue were very sparse. Thus, abnormalities in extracellular matrix synthesis or organization may contribute to development of the ocular phenotypes. Despite the abnormalities in ocular drainage structures in Foxc1 (+/-) mice, IOP was normal in almost all mice analyzed, on all genetic backgrounds and at all ages. Similar abnormalities were found in Foxc2 (+/-) mice, but no disease-associated mutations were identified in the human homolog FKHL14 in 32 ARA patients.

To date we have identified 65 missense mutations in the GALNS gene from MPS IVA patients, but the correlation between genotype and phenotype has remained unclear. We studied 17 missense mutations using biochemical approaches and 32 missense mutations, using structural analyses. Fifteen missense mutations and two newly engineered active site mutations (C79S, C79T) were characterized by transient expression analysis. Mutant proteins, except for C79S and C79T, were destabilized and detected as insoluble precursor forms while the C79S and C79T mutants were of a soluble mature size. Mutants found in the severe phenotype had no activity. Mutants found in the mild phenotype had a considerable residual activity (1. 3-13. 3% of wild-type GALNS activity). Sulfatases, including GALNS, are members of a highly conserved gene family sharing an extensive sequence homology. Thus, a tertiary structural model of human GALNS was constructed from the X-ray crystal structure of N -acetylgalacto-samine-4-sulfatase and arylsulfatase A, using homology modeling, and 32 missense mutations were investigated. Consequently, we propose that there are at least three different reasons for the severe phenotype  (i) destruction of the hydrophobic core or modification of the packing; (ii) removal of a salt bridge to destabilize the entire conformation; (iii) modification of the active site. In contrast, mild mutations were mostly located on the surface of the GALNS protein.

We recently reported that HFE, the protein defective in HH, was physically associated with the transferrin receptor (TfR) in duodenal crypt cells and proposed that mutations in HFE attenuate the uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma by duodenal crypt cells, leading to up-regulation of transporters for dietary iron. Here, we tested the hypothesis that HFE-/- mice have increased duodenal expression of the divalent metal transporter (DMT1). By 4 weeks of age, the HFE-/- mice demonstrated iron loading when compared with HFE +/+ littermates, with elevated transferrin saturations (68. 4% vs. 49. 8%) and elevated liver iron concentrations (985 micrograms vs. 381 micrograms). By using Northern blot analyses, we quantitated duodenal expression of both classes of DMT1 transcripts  one containing an iron responsive element (IRE), called DMT1 (IRE), and one containing no IRE, called DMT1 (non-IRE). The positive control for DMT1 up-regulation was a murine model of dietary iron deficiency that demonstrated greatly increased levels of duodenal DMT1 (IRE) mRNA. HFE-/- mice also demonstrated an increase in duodenal DMT1 (IRE) mRNA (average 7. 7-fold), despite their elevated transferrin saturation and hepatic iron content. Duodenal expression of DMT1 (non-IRE) was not increased, nor was hepatic expression of DMT1 increased. These data support the model for HH in which HFE mutations lead to inappropriately low crypt cell iron, with resultant stabilization of DMT1 (IRE) mRNA, up-regulation of DMT1, and increased absorption of dietary iron.\n", {"entities": [[334, 337, "GENE"], [485, 488, "GENE"], [668, 671, "GENE"], [780, 783, "GENE"], [837, 840, "GENE"], [1377, 1380, "GENE"], [1688, 1691, "GENE"], [334, 337, "GENE"], [485, 488, "GENE"], [668, 671, "GENE"], [780, 783, "GENE"], [837, 840, "GENE"], [1377, 1380, "GENE"], [1688, 1691, "GENE"], [334, 337, "GENE"], [485, 488, "GENE"], [668, 671, "GENE"], [780, 783, "GENE"], [837, 840, "GENE"], [1377, 1380, "GENE"], [1688, 1691, "GENE"], [334, 337, "GENE"], [485, 488, "GENE"], [668, 671, "GENE"], [780, 783, "GENE"], [837, 840, "GENE"], [1377, 1380, "GENE"], [1688, 1691, "GENE"], [58, 84, "DISEASE"], [147, 173, "DISEASE"], [175, 177, "DISEASE"], [191, 219, "DISEASE"], [364, 366, "DISEASE"], [1281, 1304, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Mutations in TNFRSF11A, affecting the signal peptide of RANK, cause familial expansile osteolysis.\nFamilial expansile osteolysis (FEO, MIM 174810) is a rare, autosomal dominant bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased bone remodelling.

To assess the prevalence and clinical expression of the HFE gene, we conducted a population-based study in Busselton, Australia. In 1994, we obtained blood samples for the determination of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels and the presence or absence of the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (which may contribute to increased hepatic iron levels) in 3011 unrelated white adults. We evaluated all subjects who had persistently elevated transferrin-saturation values (45 percent or higher) or were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. We recommended liver biopsy for subjects with serum ferritin levels of 300 ng per milliliter or higher. The subjects were followed for up to four years. RESULTS  Sixteen of the subjects (0. 5 percent) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, and 424 (14. 1 percent) were heterozygous. The serum transferrin saturation was 45 percent or higher in 15 of the 16 who were homozygous; in 1 subject it was 43 percent. Four of the homozygous subjects had previously been given a diagnosis of hemochromatosis, and 12 had not. Seven of these 12 patients had elevated serum ferritin levels in 1994; 6 of the 7 had further increases in 1998, and 1 had a decrease, although the value remained elevated. The serum ferritin levels in the four other homozygous patients remained in the normal range. Eleven of the 16 homozygous subjects underwent liver biopsy; 3 had hepatic fibrosis, and 1, who had a history of excessive alcohol consumption, had cirrhosis and mild microvesicular steatosis. Eight of the 16 homozygous subjects had clinical findings that were consistent with the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis, such as hepatomegaly, skin pigmentation, and arthritis. CONCLUSIONS  In a population of white adults of northern European ancestry, 0. 5 percent were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. However, only half of those who were homozygous had clinical features of hemochromatosis, and one quarter had serum ferritin levels that remained normal over a four-year period.\n", {"entities": [[211, 214, "GENE"], [379, 382, "GENE"], [2169, 2172, "GENE"], [211, 214, "GENE"], [379, 382, "GENE"], [2169, 2172, "GENE"], [211, 214, "GENE"], [379, 382, "GENE"], [2169, 2172, "GENE"], [59, 74, "DISEASE"], [105, 131, "DISEASE"], [194, 209, "DISEASE"], [281, 301, "DISEASE"], [1357, 1372, "DISEASE"], [1724, 1740, "DISEASE"], [1770, 1799, "DISEASE"], [1805, 1814, "DISEASE"], [1824, 1848, "DISEASE"], [1950, 1976, "DISEASE"], [1986, 1998, "DISEASE"], [2000, 2017, "DISEASE"], [2023, 2032, "DISEASE"], [2252, 2267, "DISEASE"]]}], ["In multivariable analysis, literacy and numeracy were independent predictors of health task performance.", {"entities": []}], ["These findings suggest that closer residential proximity to a major roadway is associated with poorer asthma control in school-age children.", {"entities": [[102, 108, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The protein deficient in Lowe syndrome is a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase.\nLowe syndrome, also known as oculocerebrorenal syndrome, is caused by mutations in the X chromosome-encoded OCRL gene. The OCRL protein is 51% identical to inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase II (5-phosphatase II) from human platelets over a span of 744 aa, suggesting that OCRL may be a similar enzyme. We engineered a construct of the OCRL cDNA that encodes amino acids homologous to the platelet 5-phosphatase for expression in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. This cDNA encodes aa 264-968 of the OCRL protein. The recombinant protein was found to catalyze the reactions also carried out by platelet 5-phosphatase II. Thus OCRL converts inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate to inositol 1, 4-bisphosphate, and it converts inositol 1, 3, 4, 5-tetrakisphosphate to inositol 1, 3, 4-trisphosphate. Most important, the enzyme converts phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. The relative ability of OCRL to catalyze the three reactions is different from that of 5-phosphatase II and from that of another 5-phosphatase isoenzyme from platelets, 5-phosphatase I. The recombinant OCRL protein hydrolyzes the phospholipid substrate 10- to 30-fold better than 5-phosphatase II, and 5-phosphatase I does not cleave the lipid at all. We also show that OCRL functions as a phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase in OCRL-expressing Sf9 cells. These results suggest that OCRL is mainly a lipid phosphatase that may control cellular levels of a critical metabolite, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate.

On the other hand, we do not find the usually observed excess of females with CP and excess of males with CLP; in VWS the sex ratios are more nearly equal. Lip pits also are equally distributed between the sexes. Affected males and females are equally likely to transmit VWS. However, there is an excess of less severely affected individuals among transmitters and a deficiency of more severely affected, brought about by a proband bias and differential fecundity. The expression of VWS is significantly modified by the genetic background  More extreme phenotypes in parents tend to produce more extreme expression in their children.

MAGEL2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain, and paternal-only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a PWS-affected individual. The orthologous mouse gene (Magel2) is located within 150 kb of NDN , is imprinted with paternal-only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting, RT-PCR and whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization. Magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of NDN , with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid-gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization.

We generated mice in which two loxP sites flank part of Piga exon 2. After crossbreeding with female mice of the EIIa-cre strain, the floxed allele undergoes Cre-mediated recombination with high efficiency during early embryonic development. Because of X chromosome inactivation, female offspring are mosaic for cells that express or lack GPI-linked proteins. Analysis of mosaic mice showed that in heart, lung, kidney, brain, and liver, mainly wild-type Piga is active, suggesting that these tissues require GPI-linked proteins. The salient exceptions were spleen, thymus, and red blood cells, which had almost equal numbers of cells expressing the wild-type or the recombined allele, implying that GPI-linked proteins are not essential for the derivation of these tissues.

Patients with familial APC (FAP) carry germ-line mutations in the APC gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life. The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation (genotype-phenotype correlation). Together with the fact that both germ-line and sporadic APC mutations cluster in the central region of the APC gene, this points to a dominant negative effect of certain APC mutants. Loss of APC function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe polyposis. Wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309. In contrast, mutant APC gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis (codon 386 or 1465) interfered only weakly with wild-type APC activity. These results suggest a molecular explanation for the genotype-phenotype correlation in FAP patients and support the idea that colorectal tumor growth might be, in part, driven by selection for a

We cloned and sequenced the four G6PD variants from Sardinia and found that only two mutations are responsible for G6PD deficiency in this area  one mutation is the cause of the G6PD Seattle-like phenotype, a milder form of G6PD deficiency; the other mutation is responsible for all forms of very severe G6PD deficiency in Sardinia and, possibly, in the Mediterranean.. \n", {"entities": [[40, 44, "GENE"], [139, 143, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [218, 222, "GENE"], [506, 510, "GENE"], [554, 558, "GENE"], [636, 640, "GENE"], [699, 703, "GENE"], [745, 749, "GENE"], [825, 829, "GENE"], [40, 44, "GENE"], [139, 143, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [218, 222, "GENE"], [506, 510, "GENE"], [554, 558, "GENE"], [636, 640, "GENE"], [699, 703, "GENE"], [745, 749, "GENE"], [825, 829, "GENE"], [40, 44, "GENE"], [139, 143, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [218, 222, "GENE"], [506, 510, "GENE"], [554, 558, "GENE"], [636, 640, "GENE"], [699, 703, "GENE"], [745, 749, "GENE"], [825, 829, "GENE"], [40, 44, "GENE"], [139, 143, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [218, 222, "GENE"], [506, 510, "GENE"], [554, 558, "GENE"], [636, 640, "GENE"], [699, 703, "GENE"], [745, 749, "GENE"], [825, 829, "GENE"], [40, 44, "GENE"], [139, 143, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [218, 222, "GENE"], [506, 510, "GENE"], [554, 558, "GENE"], [636, 640, "GENE"], [699, 703, "GENE"], [745, 749, "GENE"], [825, 829, "GENE"], [40, 44, "GENE"], [139, 143, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [218, 222, "GENE"], [506, 510, "GENE"], [554, 558, "GENE"], [636, 640, "GENE"], [699, 703, "GENE"], [745, 749, "GENE"], [825, 829, "GENE"], [40, 44, "GENE"], [139, 143, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [218, 222, "GENE"], [506, 510, "GENE"], [554, 558, "GENE"], [636, 640, "GENE"], [699, 703, "GENE"], [745, 749, "GENE"], [825, 829, "GENE"], [40, 44, "GENE"], [139, 143, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [218, 222, "GENE"], [506, 510, "GENE"], [554, 558, "GENE"], [636, 640, "GENE"], [699, 703, "GENE"], [745, 749, "GENE"], [825, 829, "GENE"], [40, 44, "GENE"], [139, 143, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [218, 222, "GENE"], [506, 510, "GENE"], [554, 558, "GENE"], [636, 640, "GENE"], [699, 703, "GENE"], [745, 749, "GENE"], [825, 829, "GENE"], [40, 44, "GENE"], [139, 143, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [218, 222, "GENE"], [506, 510, "GENE"], [554, 558, "GENE"], [636, 640, "GENE"], [699, 703, "GENE"], [745, 749, "GENE"], [825, 829, "GENE"], [218, 233, "DISEASE"], [636, 651, "DISEASE"], [699, 726, "DISEASE"], [745, 760, "DISEASE"], [825, 840, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Germline E-cadherin gene (CDH1) mutations predispose to familial gastric cancer and colorectal cancer.\nInherited mutations in the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) were described recently in three Maori kindreds with familial gastric cancer. Familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non-Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations. Therefore, we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations, by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences. Each family contained  (i) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years; or (ii) three or more cases of gastric cancer. Novel germline CDH1 mutations (a nonsense and a splice site) were detected in two families (25%). Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain. In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer; thus, in addition to six cases of gastric cancer, a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years. We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non-Maori populations. However, only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations. Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers, and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer. Thus, CDH1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers.\n", {"entities": [[26, 30, "GENE"], [147, 151, "GENE"], [397, 401, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [771, 775, "GENE"], [1110, 1114, "GENE"], [1226, 1230, "GENE"], [1369, 1373, "GENE"], [1543, 1547, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [26, 30, "GENE"], [147, 151, "GENE"], [397, 401, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [771, 775, "GENE"], [1110, 1114, "GENE"], [1226, 1230, "GENE"], [1369, 1373, "GENE"], [1543, 1547, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [26, 30, "GENE"], [147, 151, "GENE"], [397, 401, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [771, 775, "GENE"], [1110, 1114, "GENE"], [1226, 1230, "GENE"], [1369, 1373, "GENE"], [1543, 1547, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [26, 30, "GENE"], [147, 151, "GENE"], [397, 401, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [771, 775, "GENE"], [1110, 1114, "GENE"], [1226, 1230, "GENE"], [1369, 1373, "GENE"], [1543, 1547, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [26, 30, "GENE"], [147, 151, "GENE"], [397, 401, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [771, 775, "GENE"], [1110, 1114, "GENE"], [1226, 1230, "GENE"], [1369, 1373, "GENE"], [1543, 1547, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [26, 30, "GENE"], [147, 151, "GENE"], [397, 401, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [771, 775, "GENE"], [1110, 1114, "GENE"], [1226, 1230, "GENE"], [1369, 1373, "GENE"], [1543, 1547, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [26, 30, "GENE"], [147, 151, "GENE"], [397, 401, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [771, 775, "GENE"], [1110, 1114, "GENE"], [1226, 1230, "GENE"], [1369, 1373, "GENE"], [1543, 1547, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [26, 30, "GENE"], [147, 151, "GENE"], [397, 401, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [771, 775, "GENE"], [1110, 1114, "GENE"], [1226, 1230, "GENE"], [1369, 1373, "GENE"], [1543, 1547, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [26, 30, "GENE"], [147, 151, "GENE"], [397, 401, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [771, 775, "GENE"], [1110, 1114, "GENE"], [1226, 1230, "GENE"], [1369, 1373, "GENE"], [1543, 1547, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [26, 30, "GENE"], [147, 151, "GENE"], [397, 401, "GENE"], [516, 520, "GENE"], [771, 775, "GENE"], [1110, 1114, "GENE"], [1226, 1230, "GENE"], [1369, 1373, "GENE"], [1543, 1547, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [56, 79, "DISEASE"], [84, 101, "DISEASE"], [206, 229, "DISEASE"], [231, 254, "DISEASE"], [323, 337, "DISEASE"], [442, 465, "DISEASE"], [629, 643, "DISEASE"], [740, 754, "DISEASE"], [1027, 1056, "DISEASE"], [1092, 1106, "DISEASE"], [1142, 1159, "DISEASE"], [1242, 1265, "DISEASE"], [1329, 1344, "DISEASE"], [1465, 1493, "DISEASE"], [1584, 1601, "DISEASE"], [1684, 1714, "DISEASE"]]}], ["A convenience sample of 23 people completed the questionnaires on two occasions and were interviewed about their experience and their questionnaire responses.", {"entities": []}], ["Signs of irritation related to higher transmission risk were observed most frequently in subjects using soap and least frequently by those using sanitizer or HTH.", {"entities": []}], ["Higher levels of IgE-containing immune complexes (IC) have been reported in sera from patients with allergic diseases than in sera from controls.", {"entities": []}], ["Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy: correlation of phenotype by electroretinography with sites of dystrophin mutations.\nThe dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) of patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) shows a marked reduction in b-wave amplitude. Genotype-phenotype studies of mouse models for DMD show position-specific effects of the mutations upon the phenotype  mice with 5 defects of dystrophin have normal ERGs, those with defects in the central region have a normal b-wave amplitude associated with prolonged implicit times for both the b-wave and oscillatory potentials, and mice with 3 defects have a phenotype similar to that seen in  DMD/BMD patients. The mouse studies suggest a key role for the carboxyl terminal dystrophin isoform, Dp260, in retinal electrophysiology. We have undertaken a systematic evaluation of DMD/BMD patients through clinical examination and review of the literature in order to determine whether the position-specific effects of mutations noted in the mouse are present in man. We have found that, in man, a wider variation of DMD defects correlate with reductions in the b-wave amplitude. Individuals with normal ERGs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of Dp260. Our results suggest that the most important determinant in the ERG b-wave phenotype is the mutation position, rather than muscle disease severity. Forty-six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the Dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ERGs, as opposed to 94% with more distal mutations. The human genotype-phenotype correlations are consistent with a role for Dp260 in normal retinal electrophysiology and may also reflect the expression of other C-terminal dystrophin isoforms and their contributions to retinal signal transmission.. \n", {"entities": [[218, 221, "GENE"], [320, 323, "GENE"], [671, 674, "GENE"], [855, 858, "GENE"], [1091, 1094, "GENE"], [218, 221, "GENE"], [320, 323, "GENE"], [671, 674, "GENE"], [855, 858, "GENE"], [1091, 1094, "GENE"], [0, 34, "DISEASE"], [178, 216, "DISEASE"], [218, 221, "DISEASE"], [222, 225, "DISEASE"], [320, 323, "DISEASE"], [671, 674, "DISEASE"], [675, 678, "DISEASE"], [855, 858, "DISEASE"], [859, 862, "DISEASE"], [1091, 1102, "DISEASE"], [1388, 1402, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Macular dystrophy associated with mutations at codon 172 in the human retinal degeneration slow gene.\nBACKGROUND  Recently, mutations in the retinal degeneration slow (rds) gene which codes for peripherin-rds have been implicated as a cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Because this gene is expressed in both rods and cones, mutations in the rds gene might be expected to cause degeneration affecting either the scotopic or photopic systems. Mutations at codon 172 of the rds gene have been identified in three families with autosomal dominantly inherited, progressive macular dystrophy. METHODS  Affected individuals underwent ophthalmic examination, scotopic perimetry, dark adaptometry, measurement of color-contrast sensitivity, and electroretinography to characterize the photoreceptor dysfunction. RESULTS  In all but one affected member, symptoms of progressive central visual loss developed in the third or fourth decade of life accompanied by central scotoma and well-demarcated atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris of the macula. In general, cone and rod thresholds were elevated, and color-contrast sensitivity was absent in the central visual field. Peripherally, the scotopic sensitivities were normal, as was the recovery from bleach. Cone electroretinograms were diminished in amplitude, and delayed in all affected adults except one. Rod electroretinograms were normal or near normal in amplitude, and had normal implicit times. Affected asymptomatic children had macular changes, abnormal color-contrast sensitivity, and reduced pattern and cone electroretinograms. CONCLUSION  These results indicate that mutations in the rds gene can be expressed as a macular dystrophy, with evidence of primary cone dysfunction and preservation of peripheral rod function.. \n", {"entities": [[0, 17, "DISEASE"], [70, 90, "DISEASE"], [141, 161, "DISEASE"], [244, 283, "DISEASE"], [584, 601, "DISEASE"], [892, 903, "DISEASE"], [967, 982, "DISEASE"], [1003, 1044, "DISEASE"], [1049, 1079, "DISEASE"], [1712, 1729, "DISEASE"], [1756, 1772, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Preferential germline mutation of the paternal allele in retinoblastoma.\nThe event triggering malignant proliferation in 70% of retinoblastoma tumours is loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 13q14, whereby the normal retinoblastoma gene (RB1) allele is lost and an already mutated RB1 allele remains in the tumour. The first allele suffers a mutational event--deletion, duplication or point mutation (manuscript in preparation) --either in the germ line (all bilateral patients) or in a somatic retinal cell (most unilateral patients). Most bilateral patients have no family history of retinoblastoma and are presumed to have new germline mutations which arose in the egg, sperm or early embryo. We have determined the parental origin of the retained allele in nine retinoblastoma tumours from eight unrelated non-familial cases by using RB1-linked genetic markers. Six tumours retained the paternal allele and three retained the maternal allele. Of the three unilateral tumours, only one retained the paternal RB1 allele. Thus, there is no evidence that the paternal RB1 allele is preferentially retained in retinoblastoma, as has been suggested to be the case in osteosarcoma. By contrast, tumours from four of the five bilateral patients retained the paternal RB1 allele. This suggests either that new germline RB1 mutations arise more frequently during spermatogenesis than during oogenesis, or that imprinting in the early embryo affects chromosomal susceptibility to mutation.. \n", {"entities": [[239, 242, "GENE"], [282, 285, "GENE"], [839, 842, "GENE"], [1012, 1015, "GENE"], [1069, 1072, "GENE"], [1264, 1267, "GENE"], [1315, 1318, "GENE"], [239, 242, "GENE"], [282, 285, "GENE"], [839, 842, "GENE"], [1012, 1015, "GENE"], [1069, 1072, "GENE"], [1264, 1267, "GENE"], [1315, 1318, "GENE"], [239, 242, "GENE"], [282, 285, "GENE"], [839, 842, "GENE"], [1012, 1015, "GENE"], [1069, 1072, "GENE"], [1264, 1267, "GENE"], [1315, 1318, "GENE"], [239, 242, "GENE"], [282, 285, "GENE"], [839, 842, "GENE"], [1012, 1015, "GENE"], [1069, 1072, "GENE"], [1264, 1267, "GENE"], [1315, 1318, "GENE"], [239, 242, "GENE"], [282, 285, "GENE"], [839, 842, "GENE"], [1012, 1015, "GENE"], [1069, 1072, "GENE"], [1264, 1267, "GENE"], [1315, 1318, "GENE"], [239, 242, "GENE"], [282, 285, "GENE"], [839, 842, "GENE"], [1012, 1015, "GENE"], [1069, 1072, "GENE"], [1264, 1267, "GENE"], [1315, 1318, "GENE"], [57, 71, "DISEASE"], [128, 150, "DISEASE"], [218, 232, "DISEASE"], [308, 314, "DISEASE"], [587, 601, "DISEASE"], [767, 789, "DISEASE"], [871, 878, "DISEASE"], [961, 979, "DISEASE"], [1110, 1124, "DISEASE"], [1166, 1178, "DISEASE"], [1193, 1200, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Further mapping of an ataxia-telangiectasia locus to the chromosome 11q23 region.\nWe recently mapped the gene for ataxia-telangiectasia group A (ATA) to chromosome 11q22-23 by linkage analysis, using the genetic markers THY1 and pYNB3. 12 (D11S144).

This follow up study provides data on 35 gene carriers and 46 asymptomatic at risk family members in five generations. Clinical anticipation, defined as the cascade of mild, adult, childhood, or congenital disease in subsequent generations, appeared to be a relentless process, occurring in all affected branches of the family. The cascade was found to proceed asynchronously in the different branches, mainly because of an unequal number of generations with mild disease. The transition from the mild to the adult type was associated with transmission through a male parent. Stable transmission of the asymptomatic/mild phenotype showed a female transmission bias. We further examined the extent and causes of gene loss in this pedigree. Gene loss in the patient group was complete, owing to infertility of the male patients with adult onset disease and the fact that mentally retarded patients did not procreate. Out of the 46 at risk subjects in the two youngest generations, only one was found to have a full mutation. This is the only subject who may transmit the gene to the sixth generation. No protomutation carriers were found in the fourth and fifth generations. Therefore it is highly probable that the DM gene will be eliminated from this pedigree within one generation. The high population frequency of DM can at present not be explained by the contribution of asymptomatic cases in the younger generations of known families, but is probably caused by the events in the ancestral generations.. \n", {"entities": [[45, 63, "DISEASE"], [144, 162, "DISEASE"], [164, 166, "DISEASE"], [265, 267, "DISEASE"], [537, 555, "DISEASE"], [1135, 1146, "DISEASE"], [1211, 1228, "DISEASE"], [1556, 1558, "DISEASE"], [1658, 1660, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Heterogeneity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in Algeria.

BACKGROUND  SEPs and MEPs have proved useful in revealing signs of progressively severe, central dying-back axonopathy in early stages of adult-onset ALD. METHODS  Eight patients with adult-onset ALD underwent clinical examination, brain and spine MRI, and SEP and MEP studies before and after 3 years of Lorenzos oil dietary therapy. RESULTS  Before treatment, brain MRI was normal in five patients. Three of these patients had pure spinal SEP abnormalities and in the remaining two patients SEPs showed signs of involvement of both the spinal and cerebral somatosensory tracts. After treatment, the three patients with pure spinal abnormalities showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening, whereas the two patients with a more advanced stage of disease (exhibited by SEPs) showed substantially unchanged clinical and neurophysiologic features. The patients with abnormal brain MRI at the onset of treatment showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening. CONCLUSIONS  Lorenzos oil therapy had no effect on patients with evidence of inflammatory brain lesions. Moreover, in patients without clear signs of inflammatory damage, this treatment does not modify significantly the natural course of the disease. However, because effective treatments should begin before the onset of severe neurologic symptoms, SEPs and MEPs should be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of other experimental treatments in the patient with a negative brain MRI.\n", {"entities": [[73, 93, "DISEASE"], [165, 185, "DISEASE"], [187, 190, "DISEASE"], [376, 397, "DISEASE"], [429, 432, "DISEASE"], [475, 478, "DISEASE"], [713, 737, "DISEASE"], [905, 925, "DISEASE"], [1316, 1342, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Telephone-based care management programmes have been shown to improve health outcomes in some chronic diseases.", {"entities": []}], ["RNA-seq is widely used for transcriptome analysis.", {"entities": []}], ["Localization of histidase to human chromosome region 12q22----q24.1 and mouse chromosome region 10C2----D1.\nThe human gene for histidase (histidine ammonia-lyase; HAL), the enzyme deficient in histidinemia, was assigned to human chromosome 12 by Southern blot analysis of human X mouse somatic cell hybrid DNA.

The recent isolation of the responsible gene (adenomatous polyposis coli or APC) has facilitated the search for germ line mutations in affected individuals. Previous authors have used the RNase protection assay and the single-strand conformation polymorphisms procedure to screen for mutations. In this study we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE analysis of 10 APC exons (4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and part of 15) in 33 unrelated Dutch FAP patients has led to the identification of eight novel germ line mutations resulting in stop codons or frameshifts. The results reported here indicate that (1) familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of point mutations; (2) all the mutations found in this study are chain terminating; and (3) DGGE represents a rapid and sensitive technique for the detection of mutations in the unusually large APC gene. An extension of the DGGE analysis to the entire coding region in a sufficient number of clinically well-characterized, unrelated patients will facilitate the establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations. On the other hand, the occurrence of an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of mutations spread throughout the entire length of the large APC gene among the FAP patients indicates that this approach may not be useful as a rapid presymptomatic diagnostic procedure in a routine laboratory. Nevertheless, the above DGGE approach has incidentally led to the identification of a common polymorphism in exon 13.

PWS is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Five imprinted, paternally expressed genes map to the PWS region, MKRN3 (ref. 3), NDN (ref. 4), NDNL1 (ref. 5), SNRPN (refs 6-8) and IPW (ref. 9), as well as two poorly characterized framents designated PAR-1 and PAR-5 (ref. 10). Imprinting of this region involves a bipartite imprinting centre (IC), which overlaps SNRPN (refs 10, 11). Deletion of the SNRPN promoter/exon 1 region (the PWS IC element) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to PWS. Here we report a PWS family in which the father is mosaic for an IC deletion on his paternal chromosome. The deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells. We have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem (ES) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion.

The gene for EDMD on Xq28 encodes a novel protein named emerin that localizes at the nuclear membrane of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles and some other non-muscle tissues. To investigate a possible physiological role for emerin, we examined the ultrastructural localization of the protein in human skeletal muscle and HeLa cells, using ultrathin cryosections. We found that the immune-labeled colloidal gold particles were localized on the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane, but not on the nuclear pore. Emerin stayed on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear lamina, even after detergent treatment that solubilizes membrane lipids and washes out membrane proteins. These results suggest that emerin anchors at the inner nuclear membrane through the hydrophobic stretch, and protrudes from the hydrophilic region to the nucleoplasm where it interacts with the nuclear lamina. We speculate that emerin contributes to maintain the nuclear structure and stability, as well as nuclear functions, particularly in muscle tissues that have severe stress with rigorous contraction-relaxation movements and calcium flux.. \n", {"entities": [[0, 18, "DISEASE"], [35, 68, "DISEASE"], [114, 166, "DISEASE"], [168, 172, "DISEASE"], [180, 205, "DISEASE"], [257, 291, "DISEASE"], [299, 368, "DISEASE"], [374, 398, "DISEASE"], [419, 431, "DISEASE"], [446, 450, "DISEASE"]]}], ["However, due to the existence of heterogeneity and publication bias in the involved studies, our results should be interpreted with caution.", {"entities": []}], ["A highly accurate, low cost test for BRCA1 mutations.\nThe hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is associated with a high frequency of BRCA1 mutations.

We have developed an inexpensive system for gene mutational scanning, based on a combination of extensive multiplex PCR amplification and two dimensional electrophoresis. The efficiency of this system, as a screening test for BRCA1 mutations, was evaluated in a panel of 60 samples from high risk women, 14 of which contained a previously identified mutation in BRCA1. All 14 mutations were identified, as well as an additional five that had previously escaped detection. In addition to the 19 mutations, a total of 15 different polymorphic variants were scored, most of which were recurring. All were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The cost of screening per sample was calculated to be approximately US $ 70 for the manual technique used in this study, and may be reduced to approximately US $ 10 with the introduction of commercially available PCR robotics and fluorescent imaging.

The molecular analysis demonstrated that in the Habbanite population, the mutation occurred on an allele with the PD mutation. The loss of ARSA activity is due to a point mutation C > T leading to a change of proline to leucine. MLD is also frequent among Moslem Arabs in Jerusalem.

The gene alterations in TP53 and P16INK4A genes may be used as tumor markers in our family.. \n", {"entities": [[11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [1224, 1227, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [11, 15, "GENE"], [254, 258, "GENE"], [482, 486, "GENE"], [627, 631, "GENE"], [755, 759, "GENE"], [901, 905, "GENE"], [1097, 1101, "GENE"], [1283, 1287, "GENE"], [1421, 1425, "GENE"], [1527, 1531, "GENE"], [1587, 1591, "GENE"], [1714, 1718, "GENE"], [71, 91, "DISEASE"], [100, 120, "DISEASE"], [127, 154, "DISEASE"], [197, 203, "DISEASE"], [300, 307, "DISEASE"], [344, 364, "DISEASE"], [519, 525, "DISEASE"], [569, 589, "DISEASE"], [789, 794, "DISEASE"], [825, 833, "DISEASE"], [850, 865, "DISEASE"], [1049, 1057, "DISEASE"], [1127, 1132, "DISEASE"], [1371, 1391, "DISEASE"], [1598, 1606, "DISEASE"], [1607, 1622, "DISEASE"], [1675, 1688, "DISEASE"], [1753, 1758, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Control antibodies were separated from the yolks of immunized hens with phosphate buffered saline.", {"entities": []}], ["Proportions of patients experiencing adverse events were similar across groups (74.0% in the QMF149 group and 73.4% in the MF group).", {"entities": []}], ["Molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations: correlation of mutations with highly conserved domains in galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase.\nGalactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of human galactose metabolism caused by deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). The molecular basis of this disorder is at present not well understood. We report here two missense mutations which result in low or undetectable enzymatic activity. First, we identified at nucleotide 591 a transition which substitutes glutamine 188 by arginine. The mutated glutamine is not only highly conserved in evolution (conserved also in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), but is also two amino acid residues downstream from the active site histidine-proline-histidine triad and results in about 10% of normal enzymatic activity. The arginine 188 mutation is the most common galactosemia mutation characterized to date. It accounts for one-fourth of the galactosemia alleles studied. Second, we report the substitution of arginine 333 by tryptophan, caused by a transition at nucleotide 1025. The area surrounding this missense mutation is the most highly conserved domain in the homologous enzymes from E. coli, yeast, and humans, and this mutation results in undetectable enzymatic activity, suggesting that this is a severe mutation. This second mutation appears to be rare, since it was found only in the patient we sequenced.

VCFS/DGS is the most common syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements. In order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements, the deletion end-points in a large number of VCFS/DGS patients were defined by haplotype analysis. Most VCFS/DGS patients have a similar 3 Mb deletion, some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1. 5 Mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations. The high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS/DGS patients with all three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats, termed LCR22s. To support this idea further, we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 Mb region that is deleted in VCFS/DGS patients. We present models to explain how the LCR22s can mediate different homologous recombination events, thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders.

This first case of recurrent meningitis in a white patient with complete C9 deficiency suggests that this complement defect may also be a risk factor for bacterial, especially neisserial, infections.. \n", {"entities": [[68, 70, "GENE"], [110, 112, "GENE"], [185, 187, "GENE"], [345, 347, "GENE"], [679, 681, "GENE"], [868, 870, "GENE"], [930, 932, "GENE"], [1078, 1080, "GENE"], [1166, 1168, "GENE"], [68, 70, "GENE"], [110, 112, "GENE"], [185, 187, "GENE"], [345, 347, "GENE"], [679, 681, "GENE"], [868, 870, "GENE"], [930, 932, "GENE"], [1078, 1080, "GENE"], [1166, 1168, "GENE"], [68, 70, "GENE"], [110, 112, "GENE"], [185, 187, "GENE"], [345, 347, "GENE"], [679, 681, "GENE"], [868, 870, "GENE"], [930, 932, "GENE"], [1078, 1080, "GENE"], [1166, 1168, "GENE"], [68, 70, "GENE"], [110, 112, "GENE"], [185, 187, "GENE"], [345, 347, "GENE"], [679, 681, "GENE"], [868, 870, "GENE"], [930, 932, "GENE"], [1078, 1080, "GENE"], [1166, 1168, "GENE"], [68, 70, "GENE"], [110, 112, "GENE"], [185, 187, "GENE"], [345, 347, "GENE"], [679, 681, "GENE"], [868, 870, "GENE"], [930, 932, "GENE"], [1078, 1080, "GENE"], [1166, 1168, "GENE"], [68, 70, "GENE"], [110, 112, "GENE"], [185, 187, "GENE"], [345, 347, "GENE"], [679, 681, "GENE"], [868, 870, "GENE"], [930, 932, "GENE"], [1078, 1080, "GENE"], [1166, 1168, "GENE"], [68, 70, "GENE"], [110, 112, "GENE"], [185, 187, "GENE"], [345, 347, "GENE"], [679, 681, "GENE"], [868, 870, "GENE"], [930, 932, "GENE"], [1078, 1080, "GENE"], [1166, 1168, "GENE"], [68, 70, "GENE"], [110, 112, "GENE"], [185, 187, "GENE"], [345, 347, "GENE"], [679, 681, "GENE"], [868, 870, "GENE"], [930, 932, "GENE"], [1078, 1080, "GENE"], [1166, 1168, "GENE"], [68, 70, "GENE"], [110, 112, "GENE"], [185, 187, "GENE"], [345, 347, "GENE"], [679, 681, "GENE"], [868, 870, "GENE"], [930, 932, "GENE"], [1078, 1080, "GENE"], [1166, 1168, "GENE"], [10, 20, "DISEASE"], [39, 94, "DISEASE"], [110, 123, "DISEASE"], [185, 198, "DISEASE"], [368, 388, "DISEASE"], [451, 470, "DISEASE"], [513, 543, "DISEASE"], [548, 579, "DISEASE"], [583, 608, "DISEASE"], [652, 691, "DISEASE"], [859, 881, "DISEASE"], [1011, 1031, "DISEASE"], [1078, 1091, "DISEASE"], [1112, 1132, "DISEASE"], [1157, 1179, "DISEASE"], [1199, 1216, "DISEASE"], [1247, 1291, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The overall study sample was predominantly white (86%) and female (89%), with a mean age of 54 years.", {"entities": []}], ["The analyzed data indicated that all of these polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of severe RSV infection.", {"entities": []}], ["Compared with the control group, the integrated optical density (IOD) values of PERK and CHOP, the apoptotic rate of AECs, and expressions of LC3-II, Beclin-1, ATG5, ATG7, Caspase-3, and Caspase-12 expressions were significantly higher, whereas p62 expression was significantly lower in the COPD group.", {"entities": [[160, 164, "GENE"], [166, 170, "GENE"]]}], ["A potential animal model for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome through introduction of HPRT mutations into mice.\nThe human Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare neurological and behavioural disorder, affecting only males, which is caused by an inherited deficiency in the level of activity of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanosine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT).

A comparison of DNA-based and enzyme-based tests.\nBACKGROUND AND METHODS. The prevention of Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis, type 1) depends on the identification of carriers of the gene for this autosomal recessive disorder. We compared the enzyme-based test widely used in screening for Tay-Sachs disease with a test based on analysis of DNA. We developed methods to detect the three mutations in the HEXA gene that occur with high frequency among Ashkenazi Jews  two mutations cause infantile Tay-Sachs disease, and the third causes the adult-onset form of the disease. DNA segments containing these mutation sites were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and analyzed for the presence of the mutations. RESULTS. Among 62 Ashkenazi obligate carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, the three specific mutations accounted for all but one of the mutant alleles (98 percent). In 216 Ashkenazi carriers identified by the enzyme test, DNA analysis showed that 177 (82 percent) had one of the identified mutations. Of the 177, 79 percent had the exon 11 insertion mutation, 18 percent had the intron 12 splice-junction mutation, and 3 percent had the less severe exon 7 mutation associated with adult-onset disease. The results of the enzyme tests in the 39 subjects (18 percent) who were defined as carriers but in whom DNA analysis did not identify a mutant allele were probably false positive (although there remains some possibility of unidentified mutations). In addition, of 152 persons defined as noncarriers by the enzyme-based test, 1 was identified as a carrier by DNA analysis (i. e e., a false negative enzyme-test result). CONCLUSIONS. The increased specificity and predictive value of the DNA-based test make it a useful adjunct to the diagnostic tests currently used to screen for carriers of Tay-Sachs disease. \n", {"entities": [[26, 43, "DISEASE"], [158, 175, "DISEASE"], [177, 203, "DISEASE"], [268, 296, "DISEASE"], [361, 378, "DISEASE"], [568, 585, "DISEASE"], [837, 854, "DISEASE"], [1876, 1893, "DISEASE"]]}], ["General practitioners have become more aware of the potential of peak flow measurements but are still unlikely to have a meter available to assess patients seen at home.", {"entities": []}], ["Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex tissues and individual cell lineages is crucial for developing improved diagnostics and therapeutics.", {"entities": []}], ["Total deficiency of plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein in subjects homozygous and heterozygous for the intron 14 splicing defect.\nThe molecular basis of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency was investigated in 4 unrelated CETP-deficient families.

The genomic DNA of the patients was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using two oligonucleotide primers located in the intron 12 and 14 of the CETP gene, and the amplified products were directly sequenced. Two patients were homozygous for a G-to-A change at the 5-splice donor site of the intron 14. The G-to-A change would cause impaired splicing of pre-messenger RNA. The other two probands were heterozygous for the mutation, but totally lacked CETP. Their lipoprotein patterns were also similar to those of the two homozygotes. Thus, other genetic defects or metabolic factors influencing CETP expression are implicated. The data suggest that the G-to-A mutation may be common in human plasma CETP deficiency.

The classic form of ALD usually has onset in childhood (childhood cerebral ALD), with rapid neurologic deterioration leading to a vegetative state. Adult-onset cerebral ALD also presents with rapidly progressive neurologic dysfunction. Milder phenotypes such as adrenomyeloneuropathy and Addison disease only also have been recognized. Despite discovery of the causative gene, a molecular basis for the diverse clinical presentations remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES  To conduct mutational analyses in 29 Japanese patients with ALD from 29 unrelated families, to obtain knowledge of the spectrum of mutations in this gene, and to study genotype-phenotype correlations in Japanese patients. METHODS  The 29 patients comprised 13 patients with childhood cerebral ALD, 11 patients with adult-onset cerebral ALD, and 5 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy. We conducted detailed mutational analyses of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with ALD by genomic Southern blot analysis and direct nucleotide sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products derived from total RNA that was extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts, lymphoblastoid cells, or peripheral blood leukocytes. RESULTS  Three patients with adult-onset cerebral ALD were identified as having large genomic rearrangements. The remaining 26 patients were identified as having 21 independent mutations, including 12 novel mutations resulting in small nucleotide alterations in the ALD gene. Eighteen (69%) of 26 mutations were missense mutations. Most missense mutations involved amino acids conserved in homologous gene products, including PMP70, mALDRP, and Pxa1p. The AG dinucleotide deletion at position 1081-1082, which has been reported previously to be the most common mutation in white patients (12% -17%), was also identified as the most common mutation in Japanese patients (12%).

Loss of expression of imprinted, paternally expressed genes has been implicated in PWS. However, the number of imprinted genes that contribute to PWS, and the range over which the imprinting signal acts to silence one copy of the gene in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, are unknown. To identify additional imprinted genes that could contribute to the PWS phenotype and to understand the regional control of imprinting in 15q11-q13, we have constructed an imprinted transcript map of the PWS-AS deletion interval. The imprinting status of 22 expressed sequence tags derived from the radiation-hybrid human transcript maps or physical maps was determined in a reverse transcriptase-PCR assay and correlated with the position of the transcripts on the physical map. Seven new paternally expressed transcripts localize to an approximately 1. 5-Mb domain surrounding the SNRPN-associated imprinting center, which already includes four imprinted, paternally expressed genes. All other tested new transcripts in the deletion region were expressed from both alleles. A domain of exclusive paternal expression surrounding the imprinting center suggests strong regional control of the imprinting process. This study provides the means for further investigation of additional genes that cause or modify the phenotypes associated with rearrangements of 15q11-q13. \n", {"entities": [[53, 74, "DISEASE"], [79, 96, "DISEASE"], [277, 298, "DISEASE"], [300, 303, "DISEASE"], [309, 326, "DISEASE"], [328, 330, "DISEASE"], [416, 419, "DISEASE"], [479, 482, "DISEASE"], [688, 691, "DISEASE"]]}], ["We performed a secondary analyses of data in the Simvastatin for Prevention of Exacerbations in Moderate-to-Severe COPD (STATCOPE) and the Azithromycin for Prevention of Exacerbations of COPD (MACRO) studies.", {"entities": []}], ["A mutation common in non-Jewish Tay-Sachs disease: frequency and RNA studies.\nTay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation of the HEXA gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (Hex A).

The mutations most frequently cited are Q188R, K285N, S135L, and N314D. Q188R is the most common mutation in European populations or in those predominantly of European descent. Overall, it accounts for 60-70% of mutant chromosomes, but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations. Individuals homoallelic for Q188R tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems. Globally, K285N is rarer, but in many European populations it can be found on 25-40% of mutant chromosomes. It is invariably associated with a severe phenotype. S135L is found almost exclusively in African Americans. In vitro expression results are discrepant, but some individuals carrying S135L appear to exhibit GALT activity in some tissues.

However, there are differences in the abundance of GALT protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from D2 and D1 individuals. It is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the D1 and D2 alleles account for the different activities.

This study was carried out to further evaluate this risk among patients with CHH and their first-degree relatives. STUDY DESIGN  One hundred twenty-two patients with CHH were identified through 2 countrywide epidemiologic surveys in 1974 and in 1986. Their parents and nonaffected siblings were identified through the Population Register Center. This cohort underwent follow-up for cancer incidence through the Finnish Cancer Registry to the end of 1995. RESULTS  A statistically significant excess risk of cancer was seen among the patients with CHH (standardized incidence ratio 6. 9, 95% confidence interval 2. 3 to 16), which was mainly attributable to non-Hodgkins lymphoma  (standardized incidence ratio 90, 95% confidence interval 18 to 264). In addition, a significant excess risk of basal cell carcinoma was seen (standardized incidence ratio 35, 95% confidence interval 7. 2 to 102). The cancer incidence among the siblings or the parents did not differ from the average cancer incidence in the Finnish population.

The enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids with terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties. Clinically, affected hemizygous males have angiokeratoma, severe acroparesthesia, renal failure, and vasculopathy of the heart and brain. While demonstration of alpha-galactosidase deficiency in leukocytes is diagnostic in affected males, enzymatic detection of female carriers is often inconclusive, due to random X-chromosomal inactivation, underlining the need of molecular investigations for accurate genetic counseling. By use of chemical cleavage of mismatches adapted to fluorescence-based detection systems, we have characterized the mutations underlying alpha-Gal A deficiency in 16 individuals from six unrelated families with FD.

Clones hybridizing with cDNA for human ARSA were selected, examined for appropriate size inserts, and used to prepare single-stranded phage DNA. Examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations. One, a point mutation in exon 3, resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine. Introduction of this alteration into the normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in ARSA activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells. About 5% of the control expression was observed, suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated ARSA. The second mutation, a G-to-A transition, occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron. The mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site. Apparently normal levels of mRNA were generated from this allele, but no ARSA activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected. A collection of DNA samples from known or suspected MLD patients, members of their families, and normal controls was screened for these mutations. Four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 MLD patients in the sample. Gene segregation in the original patients family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data. No individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified.

II. Biological properties of C5-deficient human serum.\nThe first known human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement (C5) was documented in the accompanying report. This study examines several biological properties of C5-deficient (C5D) human serum, particularly sera obtained from two C5D homozygotes. The proband, who has inactive systemic lupus erythematosus is completely lacking C5, while her healthy half-sister has 1-2% of normal levels. Both sera were severely impaired in their ability to generate chemotactic activity for normal human neutrophils upon incubation with aggregated human gamma-globulin or Escherichia coli endotoxin. This function was fully restored in the siblings serum, and substantially improved in the probands serum, by addition of highly purified human C5 to normal serum concentrations. Sera from eight family members who were apparently heterozygous for C5 deficiency gave normal chemotactic scores. The ability of C5D serum to opsonize Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers yeast) or Candida albicans for ingestion by normal neutrophils was completely normal. In addition, C5D serum was capable of promoting normal phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus. The probands serum was incapable of mediating lysis of erythrocytes from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in both the sucrose hemolysia and acid hemolysis tests, and also lacked bactericidal activity against sensitized or unsensitized Salmonella typhi. The siblings serum, containing only 1-2% of normal C5, effectively lysed S. typhi, but only at eightfold lower serum dilutions as compared to normals.

A correlation has been demonstrated between the increase in the repeat number of this sequence and the severity of the disease. However, the clinical status of patients cannot be unambiguously ascertained solely on the basis of the number of CTG repeats. Moreover, the exclusive maternal inheritance of the congenital form remains unexplained. Our observation of differently sized repeats in various DM tissues from the same individual may explain why the size of the mutation observed in lymphocytes does not necessarily correlate with the severity and nature of symptoms. Through a molecular and genetic study of 142 families including 418 DM patients, we have investigated the dynamics of the CTG repeat meiotic instability. A positive correlation between the size of the repeat and the intergenerational enlargement was observed similarly through male and female meioses for < or = 0. 5-kb CTG sequences. Beyond 0. 5 kb, the intergenerational variation was more important through female meioses, whereas a tendency to compression was observed almost exclusively in male meioses, for > or = 1. 5-kb fragments. This implies a size- and sex-dependent meiotic instability. Moreover, segregation analysis supports the hypothesis of a maternal as well as a familial predisposition for the occurrence of the congenital form.

Twenty-eight YAC clones were identified by screening human YAC libraries with twelve PCR-based sequence-tagged sites (STSs) from the region. We assembled the YAC clones into overlapping sets by hybridizing them to a large number of DNA probes from the HD region, including the STSs. In addition, we isolated the ends of the human DNA inserts of most of the YAC clones to assist in the construction of the contig.

Correlation of physical and genetic maps of this interval indicate it includes at least 40 ESTs and six known genes including the lysosomal protease cathepsin C gene (CTSC).

The 4. 7 kb CTSC gene consists of two exons. Sequence analysis of CTSC from subjects affected with PLS from five consanguineous Turkish families identified four different mutations.

Three exon 2 mutations were identified, including a single nucleotide deletion (2692delA) of codon 349 introducing a frameshift and premature termination codon, a 2 bp deletion (2673-2674delCT) that results in introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 343, and a G-- > A substitution in codon 429 (2931G-- > A) introducing a premature termination codon.

Relative to normal HDL, the cholesteryl esters are low, free cholesterol and phospholipids essentially normal, and triglycerides increased. The ratio of apoprotein (apo) to total cholesterol in the HDL of CTX was two to three times greater than normal. In the CTX HDL, the ratio of apoAI to apoAII was high, the proportion of apoC low, and a normally minor form of apoAI increased relative to other forms. The HDL in electron micrographs appeared normal morphologically and in particle size. The abnormalities in lipoprotein distribution profile and composition of the plasma HDL result from metabolic defects that are not understood but may be linked to the genetic defect in bile acid synthesis in CTX.

A screen of 20 individuals from the midwestern USA with non-syndromic hearing loss and dilated vestibular aqueducts identified three people (15%) with PDS mutations. To determine whether PDS mutations in individuals with Pendred syndrome differ functionally from PDS mutations in individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss, we compared three common Pendred syndrome allele variants (L236P, T416P and E384G), with three PDS mutations reported only in individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss (V480D, V653A and I490L/G497S). The mutations associated with Pendred syndrome have complete loss of pendrin-induced chloride and iodide transport, while alleles unique to people with DFNB4 are able to transport both iodide and chloride, albeit at a much lower level than wild-type pendrin. We hypothesize that this residual level of anion transport is sufficient to eliminate or postpone the onset of goiter in individuals with DFNB4.

Starting from the MCC gene, a strategy was undertaken to identify constitutional submicroscopic deletions in familial adenomatous polyposis patients that might considerably narrow down the position of the APC gene. To this end, YACs identified by the MCC gene were screened across a chromosome 5-specific cosmid library to provide a source of DNA probes for genomic scanning. The cosmids isolated from these experiments were used to screen a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing chromosome 5 segregated from patients suspected to carry putative interstitial deletions. This screening approach led to the confirmation of a small heterozygous deletion in a polyposis patient that overlaps one of the two isolated YACs.

The authors earlier findings of a negative electroretinogram (ERG) in a boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) led them to investigate dystrophin gene deletions and ERGs in five boys with DMD. The authors wanted to determined whether there were similar ERG findings in an animal model for DMD, the mdx mouse. METHODS. Ganzfeld ERGs were recorded in five boys with DMD after a complete ophthalmic examination. The dystrophin gene was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. ERGs were recorded in anesthetized mdx and control mice with a modified Grass photostimulator (Grass Instrument Company, Quincy, MA). RESULTS. Ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings, yet an abnormal negative ERG was recorded for each subject. The subjects gene deletions were variable, ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions. The ERGs of the mdx mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice. CONCLUSIONS. The authors believe the unique ERG recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of DMD associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity. The ERG of the mdx mouse may be spared for several reasons, including milder effects of the mouse gene defect, differences in muscle and retinal gene product, or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin.

We have identified 43 subjects with a G6PD variant. Of these, 31 had severe G6PD deficiency, nine had mild to moderate deficiency, and three had a non-deficient electrophoretic variant. The overall rate of G6PD deficiency was 2. 6%. The frequency of G6PD deficiency, ranging from 7. 2% on the Ionian Coast to zero on the eastern side of the Lucanian Apennines, appears to be inversely related to the distance of each town examined from the Ionian Coast, suggesting that this geographic distribution may reflect, at least in part, gene flow from Greek settlers. Biochemical characterization has shown that most of the G6PD deficiency in this population is accounted for by G6PD Mediterranean. In addition, we have found several examples of two other known polymorphic variants (G6PD Cagliari and G6PD A-); three new polymorphic variants, G6PD Metaponto (class III), G6PD Montalbano (class III), and G6PD Pisticci (class IV); and two sporadic variants, G6PD Tursi (class III) and G6PD Ferrandina (class II).

To investigate its possible role, we have analyzed the coding exons of the Wilms tumor suppressor gene (WT1) for germline mutations. In ten independent cases of Denys-Drash syndrome, point mutations in the zinc finger domains of one WT1 gene copy were found. Nine of these mutations are found within exon 9 (zinc finger III); the remaining mutation is in exon 8 (zinc finger II). These mutations directly affect DNA sequence recognition. In two families analyzed, the mutations were shown to arise de novo. Wilms tumors from three individuals and one juvenile granulosa cell tumor demonstrate reduction to homozygosity for the mutated WT1 allele.

The age incidence curves for renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma in VHL disease were compatible with a single mutation model, whereas the age incidence curves for sporadic renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma suggested a two stage mutation process.

Biochemical characterization of G6PD purified from these subjects has revealed 13 new variants and several copies of previously described forms of G6PD. This study illustrates the extreme heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency among the people of Papua New Guinea.. \n", {"entities": [[226, 230, "GENE"], [253, 257, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [444, 448, "GENE"], [502, 506, "GENE"], [226, 230, "GENE"], [253, 257, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [444, 448, "GENE"], [502, 506, "GENE"], [226, 230, "GENE"], [253, 257, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [444, 448, "GENE"], [502, 506, "GENE"], [226, 230, "GENE"], [253, 257, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [444, 448, "GENE"], [502, 506, "GENE"], [226, 230, "GENE"], [253, 257, "GENE"], [329, 333, "GENE"], [444, 448, "GENE"], [502, 506, "GENE"], [0, 44, "DISEASE"], [253, 267, "DISEASE"], [502, 517, "DISEASE"]]}], ["As m\u00e9dias de PIm\u00e1x e PEm\u00e1x foram normais (72,9 \u00b1 15,2% e 67,6 \u00b1 22,2%, respectivamente).", {"entities": []}], ["Topical administration of SH plays a pivotkey role in the postoperative phase of patients undergoing FESS and nasal surgery, and positive results are generally observed in all the patients suffering from UADT chronic inflammatory disease.", {"entities": []}], ["Of those not on vitamin D supplements, 100% had vitamin D deficiency, with vitamin D levels significantly below those of historical controls.", {"entities": []}], ["From March 2006 to the last update in May 2008, we searched PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, IngentaConnect, and a local search engine (ELIN@Kalmar).", {"entities": []}], ["Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants from Italian subjects associated with severe neonatal jaundice.\nScreening for the G6PD deficiency was carried out at the Maternity Division of the Galliera Hospital in Genoa, Italy.

Complex formation induces the rapid degradation of betacatenin. In colon carcinoma cells, loss of APC leads to the accumulation of betacatenin in the nucleus, where it binds to and activates the Tcf-4 transcription factor (reviewed in [1] [2]). Here, we report the identification and genomic structure of APC homologues. Mammalian APC2, which closely resembles APC in overall domain structure, was functionally analyzed and shown to contain two SAMP domains, both of which are required for binding to conductin. Like APC, APC2 regulates the formation of active betacatenin-Tcf complexes, as demonstrated using transient transcriptional activation assays in APC -/- colon carcinoma cells. Human APC2 maps to chromosome 19p13. 3.

The gene spans 28 kb and consists of 3 exons, the first of which is entirely contained within the 5 untranslated region. Detailed analysis of genomic deletions in Norrie patients shows that they are heterogeneous, both in size and in position. By PCR analysis, we found that expression of the NDP gene was not confined to the eye or to the brain. An extensive DNA and protein sequence comparison between the human NDP gene and related genes from the database revealed homology with cysteine-rich protein-binding domains of immediate--early genes implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation.

Approximately 50-60 mutations have been reported in Caucasians and are reflected in a wide range of clinical severities. Most mutations are linked to specific haplotypes, as defined by eight polymorphic restriction sites in the PAH gene. We hypothesized that there is at least one mild mutation linked to haplotype 12 in the Swedish PKU/HPA population, since 7 of 8 patients carrying haplotype 12 had mild HPA. Sequence analysis revealed a C-to-G transversion at the second base of codon 322, resulting in a substitution of glycine for alanine, in four mutant haplotype 12 genes, and a G-to-A transition at the second base of codon 408, resulting in a substitution of glutamine for arginine, in another three mutant haplotype 12 genes. These mutations segregated with mutant haplotype 12 alleles in nuclear families but were not present on normal or other mutant alleles. Both mutations were tested in a eukaryotic expression system in which enzyme activities of different mutant PAH enzymes reflect the relative severities of the mutations, although these in vitro activities cannot be translated directly into in vivo hepatic activities. The A322G mutant PAH had about 75% and the R408Q mutant PAH about 55% of the wild-type PAH enzyme activity.

Moreover, the BRCT domain associates with the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2.

In response to this stimulus, cytoplasmic beta-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1) is stabilized, enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the LEF/TCF family. One of the target genes for beta-catenin/TCF encodes c-MYC, explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to cancer, particularly in the colon. Most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin, but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Recently, we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas. Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Here, we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour. We found nuclear LEF-1 in the dividing tumour cells, providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells. At least 75% of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein. This percentage of CTNNB1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far, and directly implicates beta-catenin/LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans.. \n", {"entities": [[209, 215, "GENE"], [1563, 1569, "GENE"], [567, 570, "GENE"], [209, 215, "GENE"], [1563, 1569, "GENE"], [15, 26, "DISEASE"], [443, 449, "DISEASE"], [483, 496, "DISEASE"], [539, 565, "DISEASE"], [567, 570, "DISEASE"], [670, 698, "DISEASE"], [855, 867, "DISEASE"], [879, 893, "DISEASE"], [1021, 1035, "DISEASE"], [1210, 1221, "DISEASE"], [1262, 1268, "DISEASE"], [1312, 1326, "DISEASE"], [1385, 1392, "DISEASE"], [1615, 1622, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Regional localisation of the Friedreich ataxia locus to human chromosome 9q13----q21.1.\nWe have previously assigned the Friedreich ataxia locus (FRDA) to chromosome 9; the current maximal lod score between FRDA and MCT112 (D9S15) is greater than 50 at a recombination fraction of theta = 0.

Subjects were from multiple geographic regions within Spain, and all suffered from hemolytic anemia, either acute (34 cases) or chronic nonspherocytic (2 cases). Almost all the variants studied presented residual erythrocyte G6PD activity ranging from 0 to 10% of normal, and five different mutants were responsible for the deficient phenotype. Three variants were similar to others previously described  G6PD Mediterranean (11 cases), G6PD Athens-like (3 cases), and G6PD Union (2 cases). The remaining variants were different from the numerous variants already reported and have been considered as new mutants. Provisionally they are called G6PD Betica (19 cases) and G6PD Menorca (1 case).

In parallel, measurement of the gut mucosal iron content as well as iron regulatory proteins allows a more informed evaluation of various hypotheses regarding the precise role of HFE in iron homeostasis.

Historically, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease has encompassed a host of neurologic disorders that present with a deficit of myelin, the membrane elaborated by glial cells that encircles and successively enwraps axons. We describe here a Pelizaeus-Merzbacher pedigree of the classical type, with X-linked inheritance, a typical clinical progression, and a pathologic loss of myelinating cells and myelin in the central nervous system. To discriminate variants of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, a set of oligonucleotide primers was constructed to polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) amplify and sequence the gene encoding proteolipid protein (PLP), a structural protein that comprises half of the protein of the myelin sheath. The PLP gene in one of two affected males and the carrier mother of this family exhibited a single base difference in the more than 2 kb of the PLP gene sequenced, a C----T transition that would create a serine substitution for proline at the carboxy end of the protein. Our results delineate the clinical features of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, define the possible molecular pathology of this dysmyelinating disorder, and address the molecular classification of inborn errors of myelin metabolism. Patients with the classical form (type I) and the more severely affected, connatal variant of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (type II) would be predicted to display mutation at the PLP locus.

The analysis of diseases linked specifically with WT1 mutations, such as Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), can provide valuable insight concerning the role of WT1 in development and disease. DDS is a rare childhood disease characterized by a nephropathy involving mesangial sclerosis, XY pseudohermaphroditism, and/or Wilms tumor (WT). DDS patients are constitutionally heterozygous for exonic point mutations in WT1, which include mutations predicted to truncate the protein within the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF) region. We report that heterozygosity for a targeted murine Wt1 allele, Wt1 (tmT396), which truncates ZF3 at codon 396, induces mesangial sclerosis characteristic of DDS in adult heterozygous and chimeric mice. Male genital defects also were evident and there was a single case of Wilms tumor in which the transcript of the nontargeted allele showed an exon 9 skipping event, implying a causal link between Wt1 dysfunction and Wilms tumorigenesis in mice.

FRDA is caused by a GAA triplet expansion in the first intron of the FRDA gene on chromosome 9q13 in 97% of patients. The FRDA gene encodes a widely expressed 210-aa protein, frataxin, which is located in mitochondria and is severely reduced in FRDA patients. Frataxin function is still unknown but the knockout of the yeast frataxin homologue gene (YFH1) showed a severe defect of mitochondrial respiration and loss of mtDNA associated with elevated intramitochondrial iron. Here we report in vivo evidence of impaired mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle of FRDA patients. Using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy we demonstrated a maximum rate of muscle mitochondrial ATP production (V (max)) below the normal range in all 12 FRDA patients and a strong negative correlation between mitochondrial V (max) and the number of GAA repeats in the smaller allele.

METHODOLOGY  PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS). A total of 84 different mutations were detected, and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals. Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations, 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity (severe PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). Then, 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications. The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity. These patients are considered functionally hemizygous. RESULTS  The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level. Cognitive performance (IQ) was also significantly related to genotype. The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96, respectively, whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84, respectively. Of the patients with PKU, 92% had been treated during childhood. Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations. Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for > 6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group. CONCLUSIONS  The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances. Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU. The significant relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy.. \n", {"entities": [[94, 130, "DISEASE"], [148, 172, "DISEASE"], [332, 356, "DISEASE"], [358, 361, "DISEASE"], [417, 438, "DISEASE"], [463, 475, "DISEASE"], [758, 761, "DISEASE"], [772, 775, "DISEASE"], [782, 785, "DISEASE"], [791, 817, "DISEASE"], [819, 822, "DISEASE"], [1374, 1387, "DISEASE"], [1410, 1413, "DISEASE"], [1445, 1448, "DISEASE"], [1468, 1471, "DISEASE"], [1528, 1531, "DISEASE"], [1556, 1559, "DISEASE"], [1606, 1609, "DISEASE"], [1669, 1672, "DISEASE"], [1859, 1862, "DISEASE"], [2011, 2035, "DISEASE"], [2191, 2194, "DISEASE"], [2417, 2420, "DISEASE"]]}], ["To date, lupin allergy is suspected to be relatively uncommon in the overall German population since lupin sensitization occurred in only 2% of non-atopic subjects.", {"entities": []}], ["Protein kinase C (PKC) mediated upregulation of TNF- \u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2 also occurs in the pulmonary arteries.", {"entities": []}], ["To date, no study has explored the relationship between OSA and atopic dermatitis (AD), an inflammatory and autoimmune skin disorder.", {"entities": [[64, 81, "DISEASE"], [71, 81, "DISEASE"]]}], ["We speculate that the NKT cells in adipose tissues may form an equivalent subset in other tissues and that these subsets are likely to participate in adipose tissue inflammation.", {"entities": []}], ["A detailed clinical and demographical data analysis was carried out along with first line drug susceptibility testing.", {"entities": []}], ["Thus, eotaxin neutralization reduces specifically BHR and lung eosinophilia transiently after each antigen exposure.", {"entities": [[63, 75, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Canavan disease: genomic organization and localization of human ASPA to 17p13-ter and conservation of the ASPA gene during evolution.\nCanavan disease, or spongy degeneration of the brain, is a severe leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA). Recently, a missense mutation was identified in human ASPA coding sequence from patients with Canavan disease. The human ASPA gene has been cloned and found to span 29 kb of the genome. Human aspartoacylase is coded by six exons intervened by five introns. The exons vary from 94 (exon III) to 514 (exon VI) bases. The exon/intron splice junction sites follow the gt/ag consensus sequence rule. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from human/mouse somatic cell hybrid cell lines localized ASPA to human chromosome 17. The human ASPA locus was further mapped in the 17p13-ter region by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The bovine aspa gene has also been cloned, and its exon/intron organization is identical to that of the human gene. The 500-base sequence upstream of the initiator ATG codon in the human gene and that in the bovine gene are 77% identical. Human ASPA coding sequences cross-hybridize with genomic DNA from yeast, chicken, rabbit, cow, dog, mouse, rat, and monkey. The specificity of cross-species hybridization of coding sequences suggests that aspartoacylase has been conserved during evolution. It should now be possible to identify mutations in the noncoding genomic sequences that lead to Canavan disease and to study the regulation of ASPA.. \n", {"entities": [[64, 68, "GENE"], [106, 110, "GENE"], [259, 263, "GENE"], [320, 324, "GENE"], [387, 391, "GENE"], [757, 761, "GENE"], [796, 800, "GENE"], [900, 904, "GENE"], [1134, 1138, "GENE"], [1528, 1532, "GENE"], [64, 68, "GENE"], [106, 110, "GENE"], [259, 263, "GENE"], [320, 324, "GENE"], [387, 391, "GENE"], [757, 761, "GENE"], [796, 800, "GENE"], [900, 904, "GENE"], [1134, 1138, "GENE"], [1528, 1532, "GENE"], [64, 68, "GENE"], [106, 110, "GENE"], [259, 263, "GENE"], [320, 324, "GENE"], [387, 391, "GENE"], [757, 761, "GENE"], [796, 800, "GENE"], [900, 904, "GENE"], [1134, 1138, "GENE"], [1528, 1532, "GENE"], [64, 68, "GENE"], [106, 110, "GENE"], [259, 263, "GENE"], [320, 324, "GENE"], [387, 391, "GENE"], [757, 761, "GENE"], [796, 800, "GENE"], [900, 904, "GENE"], [1134, 1138, "GENE"], [1528, 1532, "GENE"], [64, 68, "GENE"], [106, 110, "GENE"], [259, 263, "GENE"], [320, 324, "GENE"], [387, 391, "GENE"], [757, 761, "GENE"], [796, 800, "GENE"], [900, 904, "GENE"], [1134, 1138, "GENE"], [1528, 1532, "GENE"], [64, 68, "GENE"], [106, 110, "GENE"], [259, 263, "GENE"], [320, 324, "GENE"], [387, 391, "GENE"], [757, 761, "GENE"], [796, 800, "GENE"], [900, 904, "GENE"], [1134, 1138, "GENE"], [1528, 1532, "GENE"], [64, 68, "GENE"], [106, 110, "GENE"], [259, 263, "GENE"], [320, 324, "GENE"], [387, 391, "GENE"], [757, 761, "GENE"], [796, 800, "GENE"], [900, 904, "GENE"], [1134, 1138, "GENE"], [1528, 1532, "GENE"], [64, 68, "GENE"], [106, 110, "GENE"], [259, 263, "GENE"], [320, 324, "GENE"], [387, 391, "GENE"], [757, 761, "GENE"], [796, 800, "GENE"], [900, 904, "GENE"], [1134, 1138, "GENE"], [1528, 1532, "GENE"], [64, 68, "GENE"], [106, 110, "GENE"], [259, 263, "GENE"], [320, 324, "GENE"], [387, 391, "GENE"], [757, 761, "GENE"], [796, 800, "GENE"], [900, 904, "GENE"], [1134, 1138, "GENE"], [1528, 1532, "GENE"], [0, 15, "DISEASE"], [134, 149, "DISEASE"], [154, 186, "DISEASE"], [200, 214, "DISEASE"], [229, 257, "DISEASE"], [360, 375, "DISEASE"], [1481, 1496, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Blockage with IL-4 significantly diminished CD30 frequency in the allergen-stimulated cells.", {"entities": []}], ["Germline intronic and exonic mutations in the Wilms' tumour gene (WT1) affecting urogenital development.\nDenys-Drash syndrome is a rare human developmental disorder affecting the urogenital system and leading to renal failure, intersex disorders and Wilms tumour.

The Sit (a) alloantigen is of low frequency (1/400) in the German population. Immunochemical studies demonstrated that the Sit (a) epitopes reside on platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ia. Nucleotide sequence analysis of GPIa cDNA derived from Sit (a) -positive platelets showed C (2531) -- > T (2531) point mutation, resulting in Thr (799) Met dimorphism.

To evaluate the role of the HMG I-C component, the three DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C have now been expressed in transgenic mice.

The molecular details of ATM function in the nervous system are unclear, although the neurological lesion in ataxia-telangiectasia becomes apparent early in life, suggesting a developmental origin. The central nervous system (CNS) of Atm-null mice shows a pronounced defect in apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress, suggesting ATM functions to eliminate neurons with excessive genomic damage. Here, we report that the death effector Bax is required for a large proportion of Atm-dependent apoptosis in the developing CNS after ionizing radiation (IR). Although many of the same regions of the CNS in both Bax-/- and Atm-/- mice were radioresistant, mice nullizygous for both Bax and Atm showed additional reduction in IR-induced apoptosis in the CNS. Therefore, although the major IR-induced apoptotic pathway in the CNS requires Atm and Bax, a p53-dependent collateral pathway exists that has both Atm- and Bax-independent branches.

Most (58/71, 82%) mutations were frameshift and nonsense mutations that are predicted to cause truncation of the A-T protein; the less common mutation types were missense (9/71, 13%), splicing (3/71, 4%) and one in-frame deletion, 2546 3 (1/71, 1%). The mean survival and height distribution of 134 A-T patients correlated significantly with the specific mutations present in the patients. Patients homozygous for a single truncating mutation, typically near the N-terminal end of the gene, or heterozygous for the in-frame deletion 2546 3, were shorter and had significantly shorter survival than those heterozygous for a splice site or missense mutation, or heterozygous for two truncating mutations. Alterations of the length or amino acid composition of the A-T gene product affect the A-T clinical phenotype in different ways. Mutation analysis at the A-T locus may help estimate the prognosis of A-T patients.. \n", {"entities": [[17, 38, "DISEASE"], [72, 75, "DISEASE"], [103, 124, "DISEASE"], [126, 129, "DISEASE"], [182, 210, "DISEASE"], [258, 264, "DISEASE"], [266, 288, "DISEASE"], [465, 468, "DISEASE"], [541, 544, "DISEASE"], [784, 787, "DISEASE"], [970, 973, "DISEASE"], [1433, 1436, "DISEASE"], [1461, 1464, "DISEASE"], [1528, 1531, "DISEASE"], [1573, 1576, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Three novel aniridia mutations in the human PAX6 gene.\nAniridia (iris hypoplasia) is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder of the eye.

METHODS  We discovered a mutation caused by a C-- > T transition at base-pair 1158 of the GALT gene that results in a serine-to-leucine substitution at codon 135 (S135L). We developed a method with which to screen populations for its prevalence. We compared galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase among erythrocytes, leukocytes, and transformed lymphoblasts, as well as total body oxidation of D- (13C) -galactose to 13CO2 among three genotypes for GALT (S135L/S135L, Q188R/Q188R, and Normal/Normal). RESULTS  We found a 48% prevalence of the S135L mutation among 17 black American patients with classic galactosemia and a 1% prevalence in a population of 50 black Americans without galactosemia. The S135L mutation was not found in 84 white patients with G/G galactosemia nor in 87 white control subjects without galactosemia. We found normal whole body oxidation of D- (13C) -galactose by the patient homozygous for S135L and various degrees of enzyme impairment among different tissues. CONCLUSIONS  The S135L mutation in the GALT gene is a prevalent cause of galactosemia among black patients.

Our data provide five novel observations. First, MJD is associated with expansion fo the array from the normal range of 14-37 repeats to 68-84 repeats in most Japanese and Caucasian subjects, but no subjects were observed with expansions intermediate in size between those of the normal and MJD affected groups. Second, the expanded allele associated with MJD displays inter-generational instability, particularly in male meioses, and this instability was associated with the clinical phenomenon of anticipation. Third, the size of the expanded allele is not only inversely correlated with the age-of-onset of MJD (r = -0.738, p < 0.001), but is also correlated with the frequency of other clinical features [e.g. pseudoexophthalmos and pyramidal signs were more frequent in subjects with large repeats (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 respectively)]. Fourth, the disease phenotype is significantly more severe and had an early age of onset (16 years) in a subject homozygous for the expanded allele, which contrasts with Huntington disease and suggests that the expanded allele in the MJD1 gene could exert its effect either by a dominant negative effect (putatively excluded in HD) or by a gain of function effect as proposed for HD. Finally, Japanese and Caucasian subjects affected with MJD share haplotypes at several markers surrounding the MJD1 gene, which are uncommon in the normal Japanese and Caucasian population, and which suggests the existence either of common founders in these populations or of chromosomes susceptible to pathologic expansion of the CAG repeat in the MJD1 gene.\n", {"entities": [[173, 195, "DISEASE"], [427, 449, "DISEASE"], [451, 454, "DISEASE"], [506, 509, "DISEASE"], [748, 751, "DISEASE"], [813, 816, "DISEASE"], [1067, 1070, "DISEASE"], [1470, 1488, "DISEASE"], [1628, 1630, "DISEASE"], [1680, 1682, "DISEASE"], [1739, 1742, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Analbuminemia in a neonate.\nA small-for-gestational-age infant, found to have analbuminemia in the neonatal period, is reported and the twelve cases recorded in the world literature are reviewed.

The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs, whereas p95/nbs1 is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to DNA double-strand breaks. Here, because of the similarities between AT and NBS, we evaluated the functional interactions between ATM and p95/nbs1. Activation of the ATM kinase by ionizing radiation and induction of ATM-dependent responses in NBS cells indicated that p95/nbs1 may not be required for signalling to ATM after ionizing radiation.

Cytogenetic studies support the presence of a DGS critical region in band 22q11. In the present study, we report the results of clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular studies of 14 patients with DGS. Chromosome analysis, utilizing high-resolution banding techniques, detected interstitial deletions in five probands and was inconclusive for a deletion in three probands.

A third locus, D22S66, is deleted in the eight DGS probands tested.

Patients with FAP typically develop hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer. A subset of germline APC mutations results in an attenuated FAP (AFAP) phenotype, in which patients develop fewer tumors and develop them at an older age. Although a genotype-phenotype correlation between the locations of APC germline mutations and the development of AFAP has been well documented, the mechanism for AFAP has not been well defined. We investigated the mechanism for AFAP in patients carrying a mutant APC allele (APC (AS9)) that has a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9. APC (AS9) was found to down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription, the major tumor-suppressor function of APC, as did the wild-type APC. Mutation analysis showed that both APC (AS9) and the wild-type APC alleles were somatically mutated in most colorectal tumors from these patients. Functional analysis showed that 4666insA, a common somatic mutation in APC (AS9) in these tumors, did not inactivate the wild-type APC. Our results indicate that carriers of APC (AS9) develop fewer colorectal tumors than do typical patients with FAP because somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is necessary for colorectal tumorigenesis. However, these patients develop colorectal tumors more frequently than does the general population because APC (AS9) is inactivated by mutations that do not inactivate the wild-type APC.. \n",

Physical mapping of the derivative chromosomes, after their separation in somatic cell hybrids, reveals that the translocation disrupts the DMD gene in Xp21 within the 18-kb intron 16. Restriction mapping and sequencing of clones that span both translocation breakpoints as well as the corresponding normal regions indicate the loss of approximately 5 kb in the formation of the derivative X chromosome, with 4-6 bp deleted from chromosome 4. RFLP and Southern analyses indicate that the de novo translocation is a paternal origin and that the fathers X chromosome contains the DNA that is deleted in the derivative X. Most likely, deletion and translation arose simultaneously from a complex rearrangement event that involves three chromosomal breakpoints. Short regions of sequence homology were present at the three sites. A 5-bp sequence, GGAAT, found exactly at the translocation breakpoints on both normal chromosomes X and 4, has been preserved only on the der (4) chromosome. It is likely that the X-derived sequence GGAATCA has been lost in the formation of the der (X) chromosome, as it matches an inverted GAATCA sequence present on the opposite strand exactly at the other end of the deleted 5-kb fragment. \n", {"entities": [[471, 474, "GENE"], [617, 620, "GENE"], [471, 474, "GENE"], [617, 620, "GENE"], [442, 469, "DISEASE"], [471, 474, "DISEASE"], [617, 620, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Clinical and molecular genetics of primary dystonias.\nPrimary dystonias are movement disorders with dystonia as a major symptom.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing were employed to examine exons encoding the putative factor VIII binding domain of vWF.

The phenotypic expression of the mutation was determined to be recessive because heterozygous family members were clinically unaffected. Recombinant vWF containing the observed amino acid substitution was expressed in COS-1 cells. The mutant vWF was processed and secreted normally, and was functionally equivalent to wild-type vWF in its ability to bind to platelets. However, the mutant failed to bind factor VIII, demonstrating that the mutation was functionally related to the observed hemophilia phenotype.

Expression of FMRP in hair roots was studied by use of an FMRP-specific antibody test, and the percentage of FMRP-expressing hair roots in controls and in male fragile X patients was determined. Control individuals showed clear expression of FMRP in nearly every hair root, whereas male fragile X patients lacked expression of FMRP in almost all their hair roots. Mentally retarded female patients with a full mutation showed FMRP expression in only some of their hair roots (< 55%), and no overlap with normal female controls was observed. The advantages of this test are (1) plucking of hair follicles does no appreciable harm to the mentally retarded patient, (2) hairs can be sent in a simple envelope to a diagnostic center, and (3) the result of the test is available within 5 h of plucking.

Fmr1 knockout mice exhibit a phenotype with some similarities to humans, such as macroorchidism and behavioral abnormalities. As a step toward understanding the function of FMR1 and the determination of the potential for therapeutic approaches to fragile X syndrome, yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) transgenic mice were generated in order to determine whether the Fmr1 knockout mouse phenotype could be rescued. Several transgenic lines were generated that carried the entire FMR1 locus with extensive amounts of flanking sequence. We observed that the YAC transgene supported production of the human protein (FMRP) which was present at levels 10 to 15 times that of endogenous protein and was expressed in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. Macro-orchidism was absent in knockout mice carrying the YAC transgene indicating functional rescue by the human protein. Given the complex behavioral phenotype in fragile X patients and the mild phenotype previously reported for the Fmr1 knockout mouse, we performed a more thorough evaluation of the Fmr1 knockout phenotype using additional behavioral assays that had not previously been reported for this animal model. The mouse displayed reduced anxiety-related responses with increased exploratory behavior.

Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is widely conserved among eukaryotes. Genetic inactivation of the yeast frataxin homologue (Yfh1p) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with FRDA. These findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron-induced formation of free radicals. The functional mechanism of frataxin, however, is still unknown. We have expressed the mature form of Yfh1p (mYfh1p) in Escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro. Isolated mYfh1p is a soluble monomer (13, 783 Da) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self-associate. Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to mYfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of approximately 1. 1 MDa (megadaltons) and a diameter of 13 +/-2 nm. Each multimer consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester > 3, 000 atoms of iron. Titration of mYfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly. Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer, indicating that mYfh1p sequesters iron in an available form. In yeast mitochondria, native mYfh1p exists as monomer and a higher-order species with a molecular weight > 600, 000. After addition of (55) Fe to the medium, immunoprecipitates of this species contain > 16 atoms of (55) Fe per molecule of mYfh1p.

This mutation thus has a different geographic centre of diffusion and is probably less common than the exon 1 deletion TSD mutation in French Canadians.

The ALD locus has been mapped to Xq28, like the red and green color pigment genes. Abnormal color vision has been observed in 12 of 27 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), a milder form of ALD. Furthermore, rearrangements of the color vision gene cluster were found in four of eight ALD kindreds. This led us to propose that a single DNA rearrangement could underlie both ALD and abnormal color vision in these patients. Study of 34 French ALD patients failed to reveal a higher than expected frequency of green/red visual pigment rearrangements 3 to the red/green color vision gene complex. The previous report of such rearrangements was based on small numbers and lack of knowledge that the frequency of \" abnormal \" color vision arrays on molecular analysis was twice as high as expected on the basis of the frequency of phenotypic color vision defects. The red/green color pigment (R/GCP) region was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 14 of these patients, and we did not find any fragment size difference between the patients and normal individuals who have the same number of pigment genes. The R/GCP region was also analyzed in 29 French and seven North American ALD patients by using six genomic DNA probes, isolated from a cosmid walk, that flank the color vision genes. No deletions were found with probes that lie 3 of the green pigment genes. One of the eight previously reported ALD individuals has a long deletion 5 of the red pigment gene, a deletion causing blue cone monochromacy. This finding and the previous findings of a 45% frequency of phenotypic color vision defects in patients with AMN may suggest that the ALD/AMN gene lies 5 to the red pigment gene and that the frequent phenotypic color vision anomalies owe their origin to deleted DNA that includes regulatory genes for color vision. It is possible, however, that phenotypic color vision anomalies in AMN may be phenocopies secondary to retinal or neural involvement by the disease. The single case of blue cone monochromacy may therefore be a fortuitous coincidence of two diseases.. \n", {"entities": [[418, 421, "GENE"], [1872, 1875, "GENE"], [1901, 1904, "GENE"], [2145, 2148, "GENE"], [418, 421, "GENE"], [1872, 1875, "GENE"], [1901, 1904, "GENE"], [2145, 2148, "GENE"], [418, 421, "GENE"], [1872, 1875, "GENE"], [1901, 1904, "GENE"], [2145, 2148, "GENE"], [44, 64, "DISEASE"], [173, 202, "DISEASE"], [204, 207, "DISEASE"], [214, 217, "DISEASE"], [250, 253, "DISEASE"], [329, 350, "DISEASE"], [395, 416, "DISEASE"], [418, 421, "DISEASE"], [441, 444, "DISEASE"], [535, 538, "DISEASE"], [624, 627, "DISEASE"], [632, 653, "DISEASE"], [692, 695, "DISEASE"], [1076, 1107, "DISEASE"], [1434, 1437, "DISEASE"], [1656, 1659, "DISEASE"], [1872, 1875, "DISEASE"], [1897, 1900, "DISEASE"], [1901, 1904, "DISEASE"], [1974, 1996, "DISEASE"], [2119, 2141, "DISEASE"], [2145, 2148, "DISEASE"]]}], ["This posed a toxicological risk, especially to those who had previous diseases.", {"entities": []}], ["We used temporal and signal-to-noise analysis to identify 2 subsets of ICD-9 codes that most accurately represent ILI trends, compared nationwide sentinel ILI surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the automated data (r = 0.97), and found the most sensitive set of ICD-9 codes for respiratory illness surveillance.", {"entities": []}], ["This study, based on the triple immunofluorescence technique, describes changes in ZnT3-like immunoreactive (ZnT3-LI) enteric neurons in the porcine ileum, caused by chemically-induced inflammation.", {"entities": []}], ["Familial deficiency of the seventh component of complement associated with recurrent bacteremic infections due to Neisseria.\nThe serum of a 29-year old woman with a recent episode of disseminated gonococcal infection and a history of meningococcal meningitis and arthritis as a child was found to lack serum hemolytic complement activity.

An auxiliary beta (1) -subunit, widely expressed in excitable tissues, shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation toward more negative potentials and restores normal gating kinetics of brain and skeletal muscle Na (+) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes but has little if any functional effect on the cardiac isoform. Here, we characterize the altered effects of a human beta (1) -subunit (hbeta (1)) on the heterologously expressed hH1 mutation (T1620M) previously associated with IVF. METHODS AND RESULTS  When expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes, T1620M exhibited no persistent currents, in contrast to the LQT3 mutant channels, but the midpoint of steady-state inactivation (V (1/2)) was significantly shifted toward more positive potentials than for wild-type hH1. Coexpression of hbeta (1) did not significantly alter current decay or recovery from inactivation of wild-type hH1; however, it further shifted the V (1/2) and accelerated the recovery from inactivation of T1620M. Oocyte macropatch analysis revealed that the activation kinetics of T1620M were normal. CONCLUSIONS  It is suggested that coexpression of hbeta (1) exposes a more severe functional defect that results in a greater overlap in the relationship between channel inactivation and activation (window current) in T1620M, which is proposed to be a potential pathophysiological mechanism of IVF in vivo.

Crossovers with the VHL locus suggest that the defect responsible for the VHL phenotype is not a mutation in the RAF1 gene itself.

Sporadic renal cell carcinomas have previously been associated with the loss of regions on chromosome 3p (refs 5, 6).

Studies using DM patient materials have often produced confusing results. Therefore, to study the effects of the DM mutation in a controlled environment, we have established a cell culture model system using C2C12 mouse myoblasts. By expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human DMPK 3-UTR, we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the DM mutation. Our data show that a mutant DMPK 3-UTR, with as few as 57 CTGs, had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci. We determined by deletion analysis that an expanded (CTG) (n) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects. Furthermore, in contrast to the normal DMPK 3-UTR mRNA, a mutant DMPK 3-UTR mRNA with (CUG) (200) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Genetic analysis and the Cre- loxP system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion defect could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant DMPK 3-UTR transcript. Characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the (CTG) (n) expansion and/or the 3 end of the DMPK 3-UTR.

Almost all APC mutations that have been identified are single-nucleotide alterations, small insertions, or small deletions that would truncate the protein product of the gene. No well-characterized intragenic rearrangement of APC has been described, and the prevalence of this type of mutation in FAP patients is not clear. We screened 49 potential FAP families and identified 26 different germline APC mutations in 30 families. Four of these mutations were genomic rearrangements resulting from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by Alu elements. Two of these four rearrangements were complex, involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides. Of these four rearrangements, one resulted in the deletion of exons 11 and 12 and two others resulted in either complete or partial deletion of exon 14. The fourth rearrangement grossly altered the sequence within intron 14. Although this rearrangement did not affect any coding sequence of APC at the genomic DNA level, it caused inappropriate splicing of exon 14. These rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cDNAs and could not have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened each exon individually. The identification of a rearrangement that did not alter any coding exons yet affected the splicing further underscores the importance of using cDNA for mutation analysis. The identification of four genomic rearrangements among 30 mutations suggests that genomic rearrangements are frequent germline APC mutations.. \n", {"entities": [[30, 33, "GENE"], [145, 148, "GENE"], [273, 276, "GENE"], [488, 491, "GENE"], [661, 664, "GENE"], [1215, 1218, "GENE"], [1763, 1766, "GENE"], [30, 33, "GENE"], [145, 148, "GENE"], [273, 276, "GENE"], [488, 491, "GENE"], [661, 664, "GENE"], [1215, 1218, "GENE"], [1763, 1766, "GENE"], [256, 259, "GENE"], [559, 562, "GENE"], [611, 614, "GENE"], [30, 33, "GENE"], [145, 148, "GENE"], [273, 276, "GENE"], [488, 491, "GENE"], [661, 664, "GENE"], [1215, 1218, "GENE"], [1763, 1766, "GENE"], [30, 33, "GENE"], [145, 148, "GENE"], [273, 276, "GENE"], [488, 491, "GENE"], [661, 664, "GENE"], [1215, 1218, "GENE"], [1763, 1766, "GENE"], [256, 259, "GENE"], [559, 562, "GENE"], [611, 614, "GENE"], [256, 259, "GENE"], [559, 562, "GENE"], [611, 614, "GENE"], [30, 33, "GENE"], [145, 148, "GENE"], [273, 276, "GENE"], [488, 491, "GENE"], [661, 664, "GENE"], [1215, 1218, "GENE"], [1763, 1766, "GENE"], [30, 33, "GENE"], [145, 148, "GENE"], [273, 276, "GENE"], [488, 491, "GENE"], [661, 664, "GENE"], [1215, 1218, "GENE"], [1763, 1766, "GENE"], [30, 33, "GENE"], [145, 148, "GENE"], [273, 276, "GENE"], [488, 491, "GENE"], [661, 664, "GENE"], [1215, 1218, "GENE"], [1763, 1766, "GENE"], [30, 39, "DISEASE"], [59, 89, "DISEASE"], [117, 155, "DISEASE"], [186, 223, "DISEASE"], [224, 254, "DISEASE"], [256, 259, "DISEASE"], [273, 276, "DISEASE"], [559, 562, "DISEASE"], [611, 614, "DISEASE"], [661, 664, "DISEASE"], [1763, 1766, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Preference for EDA was indicated by the questionnaire item \u201cI would prefer an epidural regardless\u201d on a 4-point scale (1 = highly agree, 4 = highly disagree) at pregnancy week 32.", {"entities": [[15, 18, "GENE"]]}], ["The objective of this study was to determine if serum soluble CD14 (sCD14) levels are associated with lung function among agricultural workers and if this association is modified by genetic variants in CD14 .", {"entities": [[62, 66, "GENE"], [202, 206, "GENE"], [62, 66, "GENE"], [202, 206, "GENE"]]}], ["We performed multivariable logistic regression to determine the odds of ED visits by Elixhauser scores adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and residence.", {"entities": []}], ["Hereditary deficiency of the third component of complement in a child with fever, skin rash, and arthralgias: response to transfusion of whole blood.\nA previously well 34-month-old male presenting with fever, skin rash, and arthralgias was found to lack C3 by immunochemical (undetectable) and hemolytic (1% normal) assays.

Subjects with homozygous CETP deficiency caused by a gene splicing defect have markedly elevated HDL; however, heterozygotes have only mild increases in HDL. We describe two probands with a CETP missense mutation (442 D  G). Although heterozygous, they have threefold increases in HDL concentration and markedly decreased plasma CETP mass and activity, suggesting that the mutation has dominant effects on CETP and HDL in vivo. Cellular expression of mutant cDNA results in secretion of only 30% of wild type CETP activity. Moreover, coexpression of wild type and mutant cDNAs leads to inhibition of wild type secretion and activity. The dominant effects of the CETP missense mutation during cellular expression probably explains why the probands have markedly increased HDL in the heterozygous state, and suggests that the active molecular species of CETP may be multimeric.. \n", {"entities": [[230, 234, "GENE"], [338, 342, "GENE"], [503, 507, "GENE"], [642, 646, "GENE"], [719, 723, "GENE"], [822, 826, "GENE"], [975, 979, "GENE"], [1165, 1169, "GENE"], [230, 234, "GENE"], [338, 342, "GENE"], [503, 507, "GENE"], [642, 646, "GENE"], [719, 723, "GENE"], [822, 826, "GENE"], [975, 979, "GENE"], [1165, 1169, "GENE"], [230, 234, "GENE"], [338, 342, "GENE"], [503, 507, "GENE"], [642, 646, "GENE"], [719, 723, "GENE"], [822, 826, "GENE"], [975, 979, "GENE"], [1165, 1169, "GENE"], [230, 234, "GENE"], [338, 342, "GENE"], [503, 507, "GENE"], [642, 646, "GENE"], [719, 723, "GENE"], [822, 826, "GENE"], [975, 979, "GENE"], [1165, 1169, "GENE"], [230, 234, "GENE"], [338, 342, "GENE"], [503, 507, "GENE"], [642, 646, "GENE"], [719, 723, "GENE"], [822, 826, "GENE"], [975, 979, "GENE"], [1165, 1169, "GENE"], [230, 234, "GENE"], [338, 342, "GENE"], [503, 507, "GENE"], [642, 646, "GENE"], [719, 723, "GENE"], [822, 826, "GENE"], [975, 979, "GENE"], [1165, 1169, "GENE"], [230, 234, "GENE"], [338, 342, "GENE"], [503, 507, "GENE"], [642, 646, "GENE"], [719, 723, "GENE"], [822, 826, "GENE"], [975, 979, "GENE"], [1165, 1169, "GENE"], [230, 234, "GENE"], [338, 342, "GENE"], [503, 507, "GENE"], [642, 646, "GENE"], [719, 723, "GENE"], [822, 826, "GENE"], [975, 979, "GENE"], [1165, 1169, "GENE"], [177, 192, "DISEASE"], [338, 353, "DISEASE"]]}], ["The EWS gene, involved in Ewing family of tumors, malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors, codes for an RNA binding protein with novel regulatory domains.\nThe EWS gene, which maps to band q12 of human chromosome 22, is involved in a wide variety of human solid tumors including Ewing sarcoma, related primitive neuroectodermal tumors, malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors. In these tumors, the EWS is fused to genes encoding transcriptional activators/repressors, like Fli-1 or erg or ATF 1 or wt1. To better understand the function of the EWS protein, we cloned the EWS cDNA. Sequence analysis of this cDNA revealed differential splicing involving two exons encoding 72 amino acids. Both alternatively spliced transcripts, EWS and EWS-b, are expressed in a variety of cells. Because EWS proteins contain putative conserved RNA binding motifs, we studied the RNA binding properties of the EWS protein. The EWS-b protein binds to RNA in vitro and, specifically, to poly G and poly U. The RNA binding activity was localized to the carboxy terminal 86 amino acids, which constitute RGG box. Thus the amino terminal domain of EWS (NTD-EWS), which is involved in chromosome translocation may regulate the specificity of RNA binding activity of EWS. An EWS-erg chimeric protein, which is found in Ewings sarcoma cells, functions as a transcriptional activator.

This idea is based partly on the phenotype of homozygous Krox20 (Egr2) knockout mice, which display hypomyelination of the PNS and a block of Schwann cells at an early stage of differentiation. Mutations in the human EGR2 gene have recently been associated with the inherited peripheral neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy. Three of the four EGR2 mutations are dominant and occur within the zinc finger DNA-binding domain. The fourth mutation is recessive and affects the inhibitory domain (R1) that binds the NAB transcriptional co-repressors. A combination of DNA-binding assays and transcriptional analysis was used to determine the functional consequences of these mutations. The zinc finger mutations affect DNA binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with disease severity. The R1 domain mutation prevents interaction of EGR2 with the NAB co-repressors and thereby increases transcriptional activity.

Recurrent middle ear infections, a high pain threshold, and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported. There were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance. Chromosomal analysis was normal (46, XY). DNA analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities. Two years later he was re-examined because we thought his features fitted the PWS-like phenotype associated with maternal UPD (14). At that time precocious puberty was evident. DNA analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14. In all the previously described 11 cases with maternal UPD (14), a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before DNA analysis. This is the first report of diagnosis of maternal UPD (14) based on clinical features. This finding underlines the importance of DNA analysis for maternal UPD (14) in patients with a similar PWS-like phenotype even without previous identification of a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14.. \n", {"entities": [[0, 45, "DISEASE"], [106, 151, "DISEASE"], [153, 156, "DISEASE"], [248, 269, "DISEASE"], [271, 274, "DISEASE"], [287, 300, "DISEASE"], [302, 309, "DISEASE"], [316, 335, "DISEASE"], [337, 351, "DISEASE"], [367, 386, "DISEASE"], [418, 449, "DISEASE"], [558, 567, "DISEASE"], [678, 683, "DISEASE"], [721, 742, "DISEASE"], [936, 957, "DISEASE"], [1061, 1064, "DISEASE"], [1105, 1108, "DISEASE"], [1180, 1201, "DISEASE"], [1276, 1279, "DISEASE"], [1439, 1442, "DISEASE"], [1580, 1583, "DISEASE"]]}], ["EI identified 39 subjects with eosinophilic inflammation (highest values of FENO and eosinophils), which was associated with BHR and atopy.", {"entities": []}], ["A human life demand set to emerge in the future is the achievement of sustainability by maintaining a comfortable indoor environment without excessive reliance on energy-consuming air conditioners.", {"entities": []}], ["A reduction in temperature was also demonstrated over 24 h; however the reduction was not considered statically significant.", {"entities": []}], ["G130V, a common FRDA point mutation, appears to have arisen from a common founder.\nFriedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common inherited ataxia.

We previously described plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency due to an intron 14 G (+ 1) -to-A mutation (Int14 A) in several families with very high HDL-C levels in Japan. Subjects with HDL-C > or = 100 mg/dl (n = 130) were screened by PCR single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of the CETP gene. Two other mutations were identified by DNA sequencing or primer-mediated restriction map modification of PCR products  a novel intron 14 splice donor site mutation caused by a T insertion at position + 3 from the exon14/intron14 boundary (Int14 T) and a missense mutation (Asp442 to Gly) within exon 15 (D442G). The Int14 T mutation was only found in one family. However, the D442G and Int14 A mutations were highly prevalent in subjects with HDL-C > or = 60 mg/dl, with combined allele frequencies of 9%, 12%, 21% and 43% for HDL-C 60-79, 80-99, 100-119, and > or = 120 mg/dl, respectively. Furthermore, prevalences of the D442G and Int14 A mutations were extremely high in a general sample of Japanese men (n = 236), with heterozygote frequencies of 7% and 2%, respectively. These two mutations accounted for about 10% of the total variance of HDL-C in this population. The phenotype in a genetic compound heterozygote (Int14 T and Int14 A) was similar to that of Int14 A homozygotes (no detectable CETP and markedly increased HDL-C), indicating that the Int14 T produces a null allele. In four D442G homozygotes, mean HDL-C levels (86 +/- 26 mg/dl) were lower than in Int14 A homozygotes (158 +/- 35 mg/dl), reflecting residual CETP activity in plasma. In 47 D442G heterozygotes, mean HDL-C levels were 91 +/- 23 mg/dl, similar to the level in D442G homozygotes, and significantly greater than mean HDL-C levels in Int14 A heterozygotes (69 +/- 15 mg/dl). Thus, the D442G mutation acts differently to the null mutations with weaker effects on HDL in the homozygous state and stronger effects in the heterozygotes, suggesting dominant expression of a partially defective allele. CETP deficiency, reflecting two prevalent mutations (D442G and Int14 A), is the first example of a genetic deficiency state which is sufficiently common to explain a significant fraction of the variation in HDL-C in the general population.. \n", {"entities": [[343, 347, "GENE"], [597, 601, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [1839, 1843, "GENE"], [2289, 2293, "GENE"], [343, 347, "GENE"], [597, 601, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [1839, 1843, "GENE"], [2289, 2293, "GENE"], [343, 347, "GENE"], [597, 601, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [1839, 1843, "GENE"], [2289, 2293, "GENE"], [343, 347, "GENE"], [597, 601, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [1839, 1843, "GENE"], [2289, 2293, "GENE"], [343, 347, "GENE"], [597, 601, "GENE"], [1609, 1613, "GENE"], [1839, 1843, "GENE"], [2289, 2293, "GENE"], [8, 53, "DISEASE"], [307, 359, "DISEASE"], [2289, 2304, "DISEASE"], [2388, 2406, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Association of the APC tumor suppressor protein with catenins.\nMutations of APC appear to initiate sporadic and inherited forms of human colorectal cancer.

Among these patients, 49 different mutations-including 10 deletions, 2 insertions, 22 amino acid substitutions, 3 nonsense mutations, 9 splice-site defects, and 3 complex mutations-were found. All of the patients with SLS were found to carry mutations. Nineteen of the missense mutations resulted in a severe reduction of FALDH enzyme catalytic activity when expressed in mammalian cells, but one mutation (798G-- > C [K266N]) seemed to have a greater effect on mRNA stability. The splice-site mutations led to exon skipping or utilization of cryptic acceptor-splice sites. Thirty-seven mutations were private, and 12 mutations were seen in two or more probands of European or Middle Eastern descent. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the FALDH gene.

Although greater than 400 variants have been described based on clinical and biochemical criteria, little is known about the molecular basis of these G6PD deficiencies. Recently, the gene that encodes human G6PD has been cloned and sequenced, which enables us to examine directly the heterogeneity of G6PD at the DNA level. During the past 10 years, we examined the G6PD activity in 21, 271 newborn Chinese infants (11, 400 males and 9, 871 females) and identified 314 (2. 8%) males and 246 (2. 5%) females having low G6PD activity. The G6PD gene from 10 randomly selected affected individuals and their relatives was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. Our results indicate that at least four types of mutation are responsible for the G6PD polymorphism in Taiwan. The first type of mutation (487 G----A) was found in an affected Chinese with a G to A change at nucleotide 487, which results in a (163) Gly to Ser substitution. The second type of mutation (493 A----G) is a novel mutation that has not been reported in any other ethnic group and was identified in two affected Chinese. This mutation causes an A to G change at nucleotide position 493, producing an (165) Asn to Asp substitution. Interestingly, the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations create Alu I and Ava II recognition sites, respectively, which enabled us to rapidly detect these two mutations by PCR/restriction enzyme (RE) digestion method. The third mutation (1376 G----T) was found in four affected Chinese. This mutation causes a G to T change at nucleotide position 1376 that results in an (459) Arg to Leu substitution. The 1376 G----T mutation seems to be the dominant allele that causes G6PD deficiency in Taiwan. Finally, two affected Chinese were identified as having the fourth mutation (1388 G----A). This mutation causes a G to A change at nucleotide 1388 that produces an (463) Arg to His substitution. Our studies provide the direct proof of the genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency in the Chinese populations of Taiwan and the PCR/RE digestion method is suitable for simultaneous detection of the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations.\n", {"entities": [[69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [69, 73, "GENE"], [134, 138, "GENE"], [404, 408, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [555, 559, "GENE"], [620, 624, "GENE"], [772, 776, "GENE"], [791, 795, "GENE"], [1023, 1027, "GENE"], [1952, 1956, "GENE"], [2243, 2247, "GENE"], [99, 165, "DISEASE"], [191, 202, "DISEASE"], [404, 421, "DISEASE"], [1952, 1967, "DISEASE"], [2243, 2258, "DISEASE"]]}], ["We have demonstrated that nanoscale emulsions (NE), a novel mucosal adjuvant, induce robust IgA and IgG antibody responses and T H 1/T H 17 cellular immunity resulting in protection against a variety of respiratory and mucosal infections.", {"entities": []}], ["Lastly, suggestions are made regarding the role of inflammasomes in AD.", {"entities": []}], ["High-producer TGF \u03b2 1 genotypes are associated with severe lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF), but studies combining IL-8, TNF \u03b1 -, and TGF \u03b2 1(+genotype) levels and their impact on CF lung disease are scarce.", {"entities": [[75, 90, "DISEASE"], [59, 71, "DISEASE"], [187, 199, "DISEASE"], [125, 128, "GENE"]]}], ["Characterisation of molecular defects in X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (AIH1).\nAmelogenins are an heterogenous family of proteins produced by ameloblasts of the enamel organ during tooth development.

The youngest child (2 years old) was only mildly affected but had Leu-AVP levels similar to her severely affected 8-year-old brother, suggesting that unknown mechanisms may partially compensate for a deficiency of active AVP in very young children.. \n", {"entities": [[271, 274, "GENE"], [311, 314, "GENE"], [857, 860, "GENE"], [875, 878, "GENE"], [885, 888, "GENE"], [1027, 1030, "GENE"], [1051, 1054, "GENE"], [1246, 1249, "GENE"], [1397, 1400, "GENE"], [271, 274, "GENE"], [311, 314, "GENE"], [857, 860, "GENE"], [875, 878, "GENE"], [885, 888, "GENE"], [1027, 1030, "GENE"], [1051, 1054, "GENE"], [1246, 1249, "GENE"], [1397, 1400, "GENE"], [271, 274, "GENE"], [311, 314, "GENE"], [857, 860, "GENE"], [875, 878, "GENE"], [885, 888, "GENE"], [1027, 1030, "GENE"], [1051, 1054, "GENE"], [1246, 1249, "GENE"], [1397, 1400, "GENE"], [271, 274, "GENE"], [311, 314, "GENE"], [857, 860, "GENE"], [875, 878, "GENE"], [885, 888, "GENE"], [1027, 1030, "GENE"], [1051, 1054, "GENE"], [1246, 1249, "GENE"], [1397, 1400, "GENE"], [0, 64, "DISEASE"], [127, 171, "DISEASE"], [178, 205, "DISEASE"], [249, 286, "DISEASE"], [488, 503, "DISEASE"], [627, 662, "DISEASE"], [1376, 1400, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Numerous professional bodies have questioned whether traditional input-based continuing professional development (CPD) schemes are effective at measuring genuine learning and improving practice performance and patient health.", {"entities": [[114, 117, "GENE"]]}], ["Subsequently, IL-21 acts in an autocrine fashion to expand and maintain the Tr1 cells induced in vivo by nasally administered anti-CD3.", {"entities": []}], ["No replication study of this association has been published so far.", {"entities": []}], ["The murine homolog of the human breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene Brca1 maps to mouse chromosome 11D.\nThe recently cloned human breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, is located on human chromosome 17q21.

A G-to-C transition at the second base of codon 413 in exon 12 of the gene results in the substitution of Pro413 for Arg413 in the mutant protein. This mutation (R413P) results in negligible enzymatic activity when expressed in heterologous mammalian cells and is compatible with a classic PKU phenotype in the patient. Population genetic studies reveal that this mutation is tightly linked to restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotype 4, which is the predominant haplotype of the PAH locus in the Oriental population. It accounts for 13. 8% of northern Chinese and 27% of Japanese PKU alleles, but it is rare in southern Chinese (2. 2%) and is absent in the Caucasian population. The data demonstrate unambiguously that the mutation occurred after racial divergence of Orientals and Caucasians and suggest that the allele has spread throughout the Orient by a founder effect.

Latif et al., Science (Washington DC), 260  1317-1320, 1993]. Germline mutations in the VHL gene have been detected in the majority of VHL kindreds. The reported frequency of detection of VHL germline mutations has varied from 39 to 80% (J. M. Whaley et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet., 55  1092-1102, 1994; Clinical Research Group for Japan, Hum. Mol.

Recently a quantitative Southern blotting procedure was found to improve this frequency (C. Stolle et al., Hum. Mutat., 12  417-423, 1998). In the present study, we report the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as a method to detect and characterize VHL germline deletions. We reexamined a group of VHL patients shown previously by single-strand conformation and sequencing analysis not to harbor point mutations in the VHL locus. We found constitutional deletions in 29 of 30 VHL patients in this group using cosmid and P1 probes that cover the VHL locus. We then tested six phenotypically normal offspring from four of these VHL families  two were found to carry the deletion and the other four were deletion-free. In addition, germline mosaicism of the VHL gene was identified in one family. In sum, FISH was found to be a simple and reliable method to detect VHL germline deletions and practically useful in cases where other methods of screening have failed to detect a VHL gene abnormality

Renal amyloidosis, prevented by colchicine, is the most severe complication of FMF, a disorder associated with mutations in the MEFV gene. To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV-gene analysis, we investigated 90 Armenian FMF patients from 77 unrelated families that were not selected through genetic-linkage analysis. Eight mutations, one of which (R408Q) is new, were found to account for 93% of the 163 independent FMF alleles, with both FMF alleles identified in 89% of the patients. In several instances, family studies provided molecular evidence for pseudodominant transmission and incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype. The M694V homozygous genotype was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of renal amyloidosis and arthritis, compared with other genotypes (P =. 0002 and P =. 006, respectively). The demonstration of both the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV analysis and particular modes of inheritance should lead to new ways for management of FMF-including genetic counseling and therapeutic decisions in affected families.\n", {"entities": [[0, 4, "GENE"], [653, 657, "GENE"], [715, 719, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [0, 4, "GENE"], [653, 657, "GENE"], [715, 719, "GENE"], [1431, 1435, "GENE"], [45, 73, "DISEASE"], [195, 223, "DISEASE"], [225, 228, "DISEASE"], [235, 265, "DISEASE"], [462, 482, "DISEASE"], [525, 542, "DISEASE"], [604, 607, "DISEASE"], [763, 766, "DISEASE"], [959, 962, "DISEASE"], [982, 985, "DISEASE"], [1263, 1280, "DISEASE"], [1285, 1294, "DISEASE"]]}], ["For climate related health effects for which rough risk estimates are available, \u2018robust decision-making\u2019 is recommended.", {"entities": []}], ["Asthma imposes a substantial economic burden on sickness funds.", {"entities": [[0, 6, "DISEASE"]]}], ["We have designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety of peanut oral escalating immunotherapy in a 12- to 18\u2013year-old population with proved allergy to peanut.", {"entities": []}], ["Recruitment rates were 3.5% (25/724) in the incentive group and 0.6% (4/724) in the no-incentive group (AD 2.9%, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.5 - 4.5%; RR 6.3, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.2 - 17.9).", {"entities": []}], ["Severe clinical expression in X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.\nX-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a relatively rare benign neuromuscular disorder which can vary remarkably in onset, course and severity.

We have determined the structure of GLDC and of its pseudogene (psiGLDC) and studied their expression for a molecular analysis of NKH. The GLDC gene spans at least 135 kb and consists of 25 exons. All donor and acceptor sites adhere to the canonical GT-AG rule, except for the donor site of intron 21, where a variant form GC is used instead of GT. The transcription initiation site has been assigned to a residue 163 bp upstream from the translation initiation triplet by primer extension analysis. The psiGLDC gene has no intron and shares 97. 5% homology with the coding region of functional GLDC, suggesting that psiGLDC is a processed pseudogene that arose from the GLDC transcript about 4-8 million years ago. RNA blotting analysis has revealed that GLDC is expressed in human liver, kidney, brain, and placenta. We have also examined a patient with NKH with no detectable GLDC mRNA in his lymphoblasts. Exons 1-3 of the functional GLDC gene from this patient are not amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas those from control subjects are. These results suggest a large homozygous deletion (at least 30 kb) in the patient. Furthermore, we have devised a semi-quantitative PCR to estimate the number of GLDC alleles by using psiGLDC as an internal control and have confirmed the homozygosity and heterozygosity of the deletion in the patient and his parents, respectively.

The mutation (A-- > T at nt943 + 3) disrupts the 3 splice site of exon 5 leading to the deletion of this exon from MSH2 mRNA and represents the only frequent MSH2 mutation so far reported. Although this mutation was initially detected in four of 33 colorectal cancer families analysed from eastern England, more extensive analysis has reduced the frequency to four of 52 (8%) English HNPCC kindreds analysed. In contrast, the MSH2 mutation was identified in 10 of 20 (50%) separately identified colorectal families from Newfoundland. To investigate the origin of this mutation in colorectal cancer families from England (n = 4), Newfoundland (n = 10), and the United States (n = 3), haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked to MSH2 was performed. Within the English and US families there was little evidence for a recent common origin of the MSH2 splice site mutation in most families. In contrast, a common haplotype was identified at the two flanking markers (CA5 and D2S288) in eight of the Newfoundland families. These findings suggested a founder effect within Newfoundland similar to that reported by others for two MLH1 mutations in Finnish HNPCC families. We calculated age related risks of all, colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers in nt943 + 3 A-- > T MSH2 mutation carriers (n = 76) for all patients and for men and women separately. For both sexes combined, the penetrances at age 60 years for all cancers  and for colorectal cancer were 0. 86 and 0. 57, respectively.

Two missense mutations have been described  C282Y, accounting for 80% to 90% of HH chromosomes, and H63D, which is associated with a milder form of the disease representing 40% to 70% of non-C282Y HH chromosomes. We report here on the analysis of C282Y, H63D, and the 193A-- > T substitution leading to the S65C missense substitution in a large series of probands and controls. The results confirm that the C282Y substitution was the main mutation involved in hemochromatosis, accounting for 85% of carrier chromosomes, whereas the H63D substitution represented 39% of the HH chromosomes that did not carry the C282Y mutation. In addition, our screening showed that the S65C substitution was significantly enriched in probands with at least one chromosome without an assigned mutation. This substitution accounted for 7. 8% of HH chromosomes that were neither C282Y nor H63D. This enrichment of S65C among HH chromosomes suggests that the S65C substitution is associated with the mild form of hemochromatosis. \n", {"entities": [[0, 3, "GENE"], [224, 227, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [224, 227, "GENE"], [255, 258, "GENE"], [30, 45, "DISEASE"], [102, 117, "DISEASE"], [119, 145, "DISEASE"], [147, 149, "DISEASE"], [163, 199, "DISEASE"], [292, 294, "DISEASE"], [399, 401, "DISEASE"], [516, 518, "DISEASE"], [779, 794, "DISEASE"], [892, 894, "DISEASE"], [1146, 1148, "DISEASE"], [1225, 1227, "DISEASE"], [1312, 1327, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Diverse point mutations in the human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene cause enzyme deficiency and mild or severe hemolytic anemia.\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1. 1. 1. 49) deficiency is a common genetic abnormality affecting an estimated 400 million people worldwide. Clinical and biochemical analyses have identified many variants exhibiting a range of phenotypes, which have been well characterized from the hematological point of view. However, until now, their precise molecular basis has remained unknown. We have cloned and sequenced seven mutant G6PD alleles. In the nondeficient polymorphic African variant G6PD A we have found a single point mutation. The other six mutants investigated were all associated with enzyme deficiency. In one of the commonest, G6PD Mediterranean, which is associated with favism among other clinical manifestations, a single amino acid replacement was found (serine----phenylalanine)  it must be responsible for the decreased stability and the reduced catalytic efficiency of this enzyme. Single point mutations were also found in G6PD Metaponto (Southern Italy) and in G6PD Ilesha (Nigeria), which are asymptomatic, and in G6PD Chatham, which was observed in an Indian boy with neonatal jaundice. In G6PD \" Matera, \" which is now known to be the same as G6PD A-, two separate point mutations were found, one of which is the same as in G6PD A. In G6PD Santiago, a de novo mutation (glycine----arginine) is associated with severe chronic hemolytic anemia. The mutations observed show a striking predominance of C----T transitions, with CG doublets involved in four of seven cases.

The recent cloning of BRCA1 allows for the direct detection of mutations, but the feasibility of presymptomatic screening for cancer susceptibility is unknown. We analyzed genomic DNA from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or breast cancer, using SSCP assays. Variant SSCP bands were subcloned and sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen DNA from control individuals. Six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families. A frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and prostate cancer. A 40-bp deletion was detected in a patient who developed intra-abdominal carcinomatosis 1 year after prophylactic oophorectomy. Mutations were detected throughout the gene, and only one was detected in more than a single family.

To characterize the functional and structural properties of the COLIA1/PDGFB fusion protein, we generated a stable NIH3T3 cell line that contained a tumor-derived chimeric gene resulting from a COIA1 intron 7-PDGFB intron 1 fusion. Expression of the fusion protein led to morphological transformation and increased growth rate of these cells. The PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor CGP57148B reversed the transformed phenotype and reduced the growth rate of COLIA1/PDGFB-expressing cells but had no effects on control cells. The presence of dimeric COLIA1/PDGFB precursors was demonstrated through PDGFB immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled cells and also by PDGFB immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with COLIA1 antibodies. Pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the COLIA1/PDGFB precursor was processed to an end product that was indistinguishable from wild-type PDGF-BB. Finally, COLIA1/PDGFB-expressing cells generated tumors after s. c c. injection into nude mice, and tumor growth was reduced by treatment with CGP57148B. We conclude that the COLIA1/PDGFB fusion associated with DFSP contributes to tumor development through ectopic production of PDGF-BB and the formation of an autocrine loop.

The plasma cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (CETP) catalyzes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to other lipoproteins. We recently described a Japanese family with increased HDL levels and CETP deficiency due to a splicing defect of the CETP gene. To assess the frequency and phenotype of this condition, we screened 11 additional families with high HDL levels by means of a radioimmunoassay for CETP and DNA analysis. RESULTS. We found the same CETP gene mutation in four families from three different regions of Japan. Analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of the mutant CETP allele showed that all probands were homozygous for the identical haplotype. Family members homozygous for CETP deficiency (n = 10) had moderate hypercholesterolemia (mean total cholesterol level [+/- SD], 7. 01 +/- 0. 83 mmol per liter), markedly increased levels of HDL cholesterol (4. 24 +/- 1. 01 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein A-I, and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1. 99 +/- 0. 80 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein B. Members heterozygous for the deficiency (n = 20), whose CETP levels were in the lower part of the normal range, had moderately increased levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and an increased ratio of HDL subclass 2 to HDL subclass 3, as compared with unaffected family members (1. 5 +/- 0. 8 vs. 0. 7 +/- 0. 4). CETP deficiency was not found in six unrelated subjects with elevated HDL cholesterol levels who were from different parts of the United States. CONCLUSIONS. CETP deficiency appears to be a frequent cause of increased HDL levels in the population of Japan, possibly because of a founder effect. The results that we observed in heterozygotes suggest that CETP normally plays a part in the regulation of levels of HDL subclass 2. There was no evidence of premature atherosclerosis in the families with CETP deficiency. In fact, the lipoprotein profile of persons with CETP deficiency is potentially antiatherogenic and may be associated with an increased life span.  \n", {"entities": [[182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [182, 186, "GENE"], [362, 366, "GENE"], [410, 414, "GENE"], [569, 573, "GENE"], [619, 623, "GENE"], [762, 766, "GENE"], [874, 878, "GENE"], [1279, 1283, "GENE"], [1547, 1551, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1901, 1905, "GENE"], [2047, 2051, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [362, 377, "DISEASE"], [874, 889, "DISEASE"], [912, 932, "DISEASE"], [1547, 1562, "DISEASE"], [1705, 1720, "DISEASE"], [2000, 2025, "DISEASE"], [2047, 2062, "DISEASE"], [2113, 2128, "DISEASE"]]}], ["ATM-dependent phosphorylation of nibrin in response to radiation exposure.\nMutations in the gene ATM are responsible for the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), which is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction, radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition. Both the A-T phenotype and the similarity of the ATM protein to other DNA-damage sensors suggests a role for ATM in biochemical pathways involved in the recognition, signalling and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). There are strong parallels between the pattern of radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition in A-T patients and that in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). The protein defective in NBS, nibrin (encoded by NBS1), forms a complex with MRE11 and RAD50 (refs 1, 2). This complex localizes to DSBs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a longer period of time. The overlap between clinical and cellular phenotypes in A-T and NBS suggests that ATM and nibrin may function in the same biochemical pathway. Here we demonstrate that nibrin is phosphorylated within one hour of treatment of cells with IR. This response is abrogated in A-T cells that either do not express ATM protein or express near full-length mutant protein. We also show that ATM physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of this site appears to be functionally important because mutated nibrin (S343A) does not completely complement radiosensitivity in NBS cells. ATM phosphorylation of nibrin does not affect nibrin-MRE11-RAD50 association as revealed by radiation-induced foci formation. Our data provide a biochemical explanation for the similarity in phenotype between A-T and NBS.. \n", {"entities": [[0, 3, "GENE"], [97, 100, "GENE"], [339, 342, "GENE"], [399, 402, "GENE"], [1077, 1080, "GENE"], [1302, 1305, "GENE"], [1376, 1379, "GENE"], [1632, 1635, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [97, 100, "GENE"], [339, 342, "GENE"], [399, 402, "GENE"], [1077, 1080, "GENE"], [1302, 1305, "GENE"], [1376, 1379, "GENE"], [1632, 1635, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [97, 100, "GENE"], [339, 342, "GENE"], [399, 402, "GENE"], [1077, 1080, "GENE"], [1302, 1305, "GENE"], [1376, 1379, "GENE"], [1632, 1635, "GENE"], [795, 800, "GENE"], [1691, 1696, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [97, 100, "GENE"], [339, 342, "GENE"], [399, 402, "GENE"], [1077, 1080, "GENE"], [1302, 1305, "GENE"], [1376, 1379, "GENE"], [1632, 1635, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [97, 100, "GENE"], [339, 342, "GENE"], [399, 402, "GENE"], [1077, 1080, "GENE"], [1302, 1305, "GENE"], [1376, 1379, "GENE"], [1632, 1635, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [97, 100, "GENE"], [339, 342, "GENE"], [399, 402, "GENE"], [1077, 1080, "GENE"], [1302, 1305, "GENE"], [1376, 1379, "GENE"], [1632, 1635, "GENE"], [0, 3, "GENE"], [97, 100, "GENE"], [339, 342, "GENE"], [399, 402, "GENE"], [1077, 1080, "GENE"], [1302, 1305, "GENE"], [1376, 1379, "GENE"], [1632, 1635, "GENE"], [125, 141, "DISEASE"], [142, 163, "DISEASE"], [165, 168, "DISEASE"], [197, 219, "DISEASE"], [267, 273, "DISEASE"], [299, 302, "DISEASE"], [610, 616, "DISEASE"], [635, 638, "DISEASE"], [674, 700, "DISEASE"], [702, 705, "DISEASE"], [733, 736, "DISEASE"], [1051, 1054, "DISEASE"], [1059, 1062, "DISEASE"], [1265, 1268, "DISEASE"], [1621, 1624, "DISEASE"], [1841, 1844, "DISEASE"], [1849, 1852, "DISEASE"]]}], ["After controlling for the number of reported disease cases and Internet access rate by state, we estimate the contribution of social factors to the public health risk perception levels by state ( R =23.37%).", {"entities": []}], ["The estimated prevalence of chronic diseases varies considerably depending of the source(s) of information used.", {"entities": []}], ["Consecutive sixty-nine participants with RAS were recruited into this non-randomized double blind, controlled cohort observational study (test group).", {"entities": []}], ["Detection of a novel arginine vasopressin defect by dideoxy fingerprinting.\nAutosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is a familial form of diabetes insipidus.

We identified a new splice-site mutation affecting intron 4 of the PDS gene, at nucleotide position 639 + 7. RNA analysis from lymphocytes of the affected patients showed that mutation 639 + 7A-- > G generates a new donor splice site, leading to an mRNA with an insertion of six nucleotides from intron 4 of PDS.

We used polyclonal and monoclonal anti-fusion protein antibodies to identify native huntingtin in rat, monkey, and human. Western blots revealed a protein with the expected molecular weight which is present in the soluble fraction of rat and monkey brain tissues and lymphoblastoid cells from control cases. In lymphoblastoid cell lines from juvenile-onset heterozygote HD cases, both normal and mutant huntingtin are expressed, and increasing repeat expansion leads to lower levels of the mutant protein. Immunocytochemistry indicates that huntingtin is located in neurons throughout the brain, with the highest levels evident in larger neurons. In the human striatum, huntingtin is enriched in a patch-like distribution, potentially corresponding to the first areas affected in HD. Subcellular localization of huntingtin is consistent with a cytosolic protein primarily found in somatodendritic regions.

However, there have also been cases with an intergenerational contraction of the repeat. We examined 1, 489 DM parent-offspring pairs, of which 95 (6. 4%) showed such contractions in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). In 56 of the 95 pairs, clinical data allowed an analysis of their anticipation status. It is surprising that anticipation occurred in 27 (48%) of these 56 pairs, while none clearly showed a later onset of DM in the symptomatic offspring. The contraction occurred in 76 (10%) of 753 paternal transmissions and in 19 (3%) of 736 maternal transmissions. Anticipation was observed more frequently in maternal (85%) than in paternal (37%) transmissions (P <. 001). The parental repeat size correlated with the size of intergenerational contraction (r2 =. 50, P < <. 001), and the slope of linear regression was steeper in paternal (-. 62) than in maternal (-. 30) transmissions (P < <. 001). Sixteen DM parents had multiple DM offspring with the CTG repeat contractions. This frequency was higher than the frequency expected from the probability of the repeat contractions (6. 4%) and the size of DM sib population (1. 54 DM offspring per DM parent, in 968 DM parents). We conclude that (1) intergenerational contractions of the CTG repeat in leukocyte DNA frequently accompanies apparent anticipation, especially when DM is maternally transmitted, and (2) the paternal origin of the repeat and the presence of the repeat contraction in a sibling increase the probability of the CTG repeat contraction \n", {"entities": [[71, 89, "DISEASE"], [94, 112, "DISEASE"], [114, 116, "DISEASE"], [151, 153, "DISEASE"], [360, 362, "DISEASE"], [675, 677, "DISEASE"], [1165, 1167, "DISEASE"], [1189, 1191, "DISEASE"], [1362, 1364, "DISEASE"], [1387, 1389, "DISEASE"], [1404, 1406, "DISEASE"], [1422, 1424, "DISEASE"], [1584, 1586, "DISEASE"]]}], ["This study supports previous findings of M2 macrophage polarization in asthmatic subjects during the acute course of the allergic inflammation and provides evidence for their contribution to the Th2 inflammation.", {"entities": []}], ["Digital communication enables timely access for young people to the right clinician at the time when it can make a difference to how they manage their health condition.", {"entities": []}], ["Our survey target was measles patients treated at Chiba-Nishi general hospital from January 1999 to September 2001.", {"entities": [[22, 29, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Molecular and metabolic basis for the metabolic disorder normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia.\nWe have previously described a disorder, normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia, that is characterized by the virtual absence of plasma low density lipoproteins and complete absence of apoB-100, but with apparently normal secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins containing apoB-48.

A 28-base pair gene deletion causes skipping of exon 6 during RNA splicing.\nTwo variants of a genetic deficiency of complement protein C2 (C2D) have been previously identified. No C2 protein translation is detected in type I deficiency, while type II deficiency is characterized by a selective block in C2 secretion. Type I C2 deficiency was described in a family in which the C2 null allele (C2Q0) is associated with the major histocompatibility haplotype/complotype HLA-A25, B18, C2Q0, BfS, C4A4, C4B2, Drw2; this extended haplotype occurs in over 90% of C2-deficient individuals (common complotype/haplotype). To determine the molecular basis of type I C2 deficiency, the C2 gene and cDNA were characterized from a homozygous type I C2-deficient individual with the common associated haplotype/complotype. We found a 28-base pair deletion in the type I C2Q0 gene, beginning 9 base pairs upstream of the 3-end of exon 6, that generates a C2 transcript with a complete deletion of exon 6 (134 base pair) and a premature termination codon. In studies of eight kindred, the 28-base pair deletion was observed in all C2Q0 alleles associated with the common type I deficient complotype/haplotype; this deletion was not present in normal C2 nor in type II C2-deficient genes. These data demonstrate that  1) type I human complement C2 deficiency is caused by a 28-base pair genomic deletion that causes skipping of exon 6 during RNA splicing, resulting in generation of a premature termination codon, 2) the 28-base pair deletion in the type I C2Q0 gene is strongly associated with the HLA haplotype/complotype A25, B18, C2Q0, BfS, C4A4, C4B2, Drw2, suggesting that all C2-deficient individuals with this haplotype/complotype will harbor the 28-base pair C2 gene deletion, and 3) type II C2 deficiency is caused by a different, as yet uncharacterized, molecular genetic

We postulated that a specific pattern of VHL mutations is associated with sporadic RCC. This pattern corresponds to mutations leading mainly to truncated proteins with few specific missense mutations. We then analyzed the occurrence of RCC in VHL families, based on the nature of mutations. We observed RCC in at least one member of the VHL families in 77% of cases with mutations leading to truncated proteins versus 55% in cases with missense mutations (P < 0. 05).

Here we report the autoinhibited structure of the GTPase-binding domain of WASP, which can be induced by the C-terminal region or by organic co-solvents. In the autoinhibited complex, intramolecular interactions with the GTPase-binding domain occlude residues of the C terminus that regulate the Arp2/3 actin-nucleating complex. Binding of Cdc42 to the GTPase-binding domain causes a dramatic conformational change, resulting in disruption of the hydrophobic core and release of the C terminus, enabling its interaction with the actin regulatory machinery.

Truncating germline and somatic mutations (or, infrequently, allelic loss) occur in tumors in FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis). Most sporadic colorectal cancers also have two APC mutations. Clues from attenuated polyposis, missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1, 250-1, 450) indicate, however, that APC mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function. We have found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations within a small region (codons 1, 194-1, 392 at most) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas, in contrast to other FAP patients, whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region. Our results indicate that different APC mutations provide cells with different selective advantages, with mutations close to codon 1, 300 providing the greatest advantage. Allelic loss is selected strongly in cells with one mutation near codon 1, 300. A different germline-somatic APC mutation association exists in FAP desmoids. APC is not, therefore, a classical tumor suppressor.

DXS42 was mapped to the derivative chromosome X containing Xpterq25, and DXS10 was mapped to the derivative chromosome 3 containing Xq25-qter.

Although the biochemical function of BRCA1 is not well understood, it is important for DNA damage repair and cell-cycle checkpoint. BRCA1 exists in nuclear foci but is hyperphosphorylated and disperses after DNA damage. It is not known whether BRCA1 phosphorylation and dispersion and its function in DNA damage response are related. In yeast the DNA damage response and the replication-block checkpoint are mediated partly through the Cds1 kinase family. Here we report that the human Cds1 kinase (hCds1/Chk2) regulates BRCA1 function after DNA damage by phosphorylating serine 988 of BRCA1. We show that hCds1 and BRCA1 interact and co-localize within discrete nuclear foci but separate after gamma irradiation. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 at serine 988 is required for the release of BRCA1 from hCds1. This phosphorylation is also important for the ability of BRCA1 to restore survival after DNA damage in the BRCA1-mutated cell line HCC1937.. \n", {"entities": [[34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [704, 708, "GENE"], [754, 758, "GENE"], [704, 708, "GENE"], [754, 758, "GENE"], [34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [34, 39, "GENE"], [92, 97, "GENE"], [305, 310, "GENE"], [400, 405, "GENE"], [512, 517, "GENE"], [789, 794, "GENE"], [854, 859, "GENE"], [884, 889, "GENE"], [1001, 1006, "GENE"], [1052, 1057, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1178, 1183, "GENE"], [107, 113, "DISEASE"], [175, 211, "DISEASE"], [253, 266, "DISEASE"]]}], ["While observational studies have reported significant corticosteroid-associated mortality after adjusting for baseline differences in patients treated with corticosteroids or not, corticosteroids have remained a common treatment in subsequent influenza outbreaks, including avian influenza A(H7N9).", {"entities": [[243, 252, "DISEASE"], [280, 289, "DISEASE"], [274, 289, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Sleep apnea syndrome is a highly prevalent disorder that is still underdiagnosed and undertreated and whose obstructive form is the most common.", {"entities": [[12, 20, "DISEASE"]]}], ["This demands socio-technical solutions that may easily become enmeshed in protracted debate and controversy as they encounter the norms, values, expectations and concerns of diverse stakeholders.", {"entities": []}], ["As expected for a multifunctional protein, a wide tissue distribution was observed.", {"entities": []}], ["mRNA levels of TLR2 and its downstream molecules, NF-\u03baB and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF )-\u03b1, were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT\u2013PCR).", {"entities": [[15, 19, "GENE"], [84, 87, "GENE"]]}], ["We identified an 11-amino-acid peptide, H-RN, from hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), an endogenous protein with anti-inflammatory properties.", {"entities": [[77, 80, "GENE"]]}], ["Ataxin-3 with an altered conformation that exposes the polyglutamine domain is associated with the nuclear matrix.\nSpinocerebellar ataxia type-3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is a member of the CAG/polyglutamine repeat disease family. In this family of disorders, a normally polymorphic CAG repeat becomes expanded, resulting in expression of an expanded polyglutamine domain in the disease gene product. Experimental models of polyglutamine disease implicate the nucleus in pathogenesis; however, the link between intranuclear expression of expanded polyglutamine and neuronal dysfunction remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ataxin-3, the disease protein in SCA3/MJD, adopts a unique conformation when expressed within the nucleus of transfected cells. The monoclonal antibody 1C2 is known preferentially to bind expanded polyglutamine, but we find that it also binds a fragment of ataxin-3 containing a normal glutamine repeat. In addition, expression of ataxin-3 within the nucleus exposes the glutamine domain of the full-length non-pathological protein, allowing it to bind the monoclonal antibody 1C2. Fractionation and immunochemical experiments indicate that this novel conformation of intranuclear ataxin-3 is not due to proteolysis, suggesting instead that association with nuclear protein (s) alters the structure of full-length ataxin-3 which exposes the polyglutamine domain. This conformationally altered ataxin-3 is bound to the nuclear matrix. The pathological form of ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine domain also associates with the nuclear matrix. These data suggest that an early event in the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD may be an altered conformation of ataxin-3 within the nucleus that exposes the polyglutamine domain.. \n", {"entities": [[115, 144, "DISEASE"], [148, 170, "DISEASE"], [172, 176, "DISEASE"], [177, 180, "DISEASE"], [201, 233, "DISEASE"], [435, 456, "DISEASE"], [576, 596, "DISEASE"], [672, 676, "DISEASE"], [677, 680, "DISEASE"], [1648, 1652, "DISEASE"], [1653, 1656, "DISEASE"]]}], ["It is not known how DEP exposure activates airway afferents to elicit symptoms, such as cough and bronchospasm.", {"entities": []}], ["This study investigated the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship between exposure of mepolizumab subcutaneous (SC) administration and blood eosinophil reduction compared with intravenous (IV) administration in adult subjects with asthma.", {"entities": [[248, 254, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Odds ratios were determined using polytomous logistic regression for polyp number (0 or \u22653) and polyp type (no polyp, hyperplastic polyp, tubular adenoma).", {"entities": [[146, 153, "DISEASE"]]}], ["A high incidence of BRCA1 mutations in 20 breast-ovarian cancer families.\nWe have analyzed 20 breast-ovarian cancer families, the majority of which show positive evidence of linkage to chromosome 17q12 for germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 gene.

Six APOC2 RFLPs (TaqI, BglI, BanI, BamHI, NcoI, and AvaII) have been identified to date. We have conducted a comprehensive DM linkage study utilizing all six RFLPs and involving 50 families and 372 individuals.

A substantial increase in the lod scores over those seen with the individual RFLPs was obtained when the linkage of the entire APOC2 haplotype (composed of the six RFLPs) was studied (lod = 17. 87, theta = 0. 04). We have observed significant inter-APOC2 RFLP linkage disequilibrium. Consequently, the three most informative RFLPs have been found to be BanI, TaqI, and either BglI, AvaII, or NcoI polymorphisms.

The gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired-type DNA-binding domain. The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA-binding subdomains, the N-terminal subdomain (NTS) and the C-terminal subdomain (CTS), which bind respective consensus DNA sequences. The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain. The insertion, into the NTS, of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA-binding ability of the CTS. Thus, exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes. We ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with Peters anomaly, congenital cataract, Axenfeldt anomaly, and/or foveal hypoplasia, which, to our knowledge, is the first mutation identified in the splice-variant region. A T-- > A transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val-- > Asp (GTC-- > GAC) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region. Functional analyses demonstrated that the V54D mutation slightly increased NTS binding and decreased CTS transactivation activity to almost half.. \n", {"entities": [[58, 62, "GENE"], [90, 94, "GENE"], [141, 145, "GENE"], [624, 628, "GENE"], [58, 62, "GENE"], [90, 94, "GENE"], [141, 145, "GENE"], [624, 628, "GENE"], [58, 62, "GENE"], [90, 94, "GENE"], [141, 145, "GENE"], [624, 628, "GENE"], [526, 529, "GENE"], [754, 757, "GENE"], [849, 852, "GENE"], [1462, 1465, "GENE"], [58, 62, "GENE"], [90, 94, "GENE"], [141, 145, "GENE"], [624, 628, "GENE"], [526, 529, "GENE"], [754, 757, "GENE"], [849, 852, "GENE"], [1462, 1465, "GENE"], [526, 529, "GENE"], [754, 757, "GENE"], [849, 852, "GENE"], [1462, 1465, "GENE"], [526, 529, "GENE"], [754, 757, "GENE"], [849, 852, "GENE"], [1462, 1465, "GENE"], [71, 84, "DISEASE"], [195, 211, "DISEASE"], [223, 231, "DISEASE"], [233, 247, "DISEASE"], [249, 266, "DISEASE"], [268, 287, "DISEASE"], [293, 310, "DISEASE"], [1050, 1064, "DISEASE"], [1066, 1085, "DISEASE"], [1087, 1104, "DISEASE"], [1113, 1130, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Moreover, the study addressed potential confounding by including two comparison groups with children who grew up under similarly adverse living conditions but did not experience placement.", {"entities": []}], ["We also hypothesized that this relationship would be attenuated by high exposure to the air pollutant black carbon (BC).", {"entities": []}], ["Conventional and CRM asphalt workers showed higher 1-OH-PYR and 2-OH-PH than controls ( p \u2009<\u20090.001 for all).", {"entities": []}], ["Endotoxin, a component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria, is a contaminant in organic dusts (house dust) and aerosols.", {"entities": []}], ["Besides, child-suitable drug preparations should be promoted to ensure patient safety.", {"entities": []}], ["Thirty adults with long-term conditions, 14 female, 16 male aged 40\u201374 years, mean age 62 years, 24 white British, 1 white Irish, 5 from black and minority ethnic communities.", {"entities": []}], ["Heterozygous loss of Six5 in mice is sufficient to cause ocular cataracts.\nMyotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal muscle wasting, myotonia, cardiac arrhythmia, hyperinsulinaemia, mental retardation and ocular cataracts. The genetic defect in DM is a CTG repeat expansion located in the 3 untranslated region of DMPK and 5 of a homeodomain-encoding gene, SIX5 (formerly DMAHP; refs 2-5). There are three mechanisms by which CTG expansion can result in DM. First, repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant DMPK mRNA and consequently reduce DMPK levels. Second, CTG expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 of the repeat sequence and decrease SIX5 transcription. Third, toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of DNA or RNA (refs 10, 11). Previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent loss of Dm15 (the mouse DMPK homologue) in mice produces a partial DM phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders. To test the role of Six5 loss in DM, we have analysed a strain of mice in which Six5 was deleted. Our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of cataract formation is inversely related to Six5 dosage and is temporally progressive. Six5 +/- and Six5-/- mice show increased steady-state levels of the Na +/K + -ATPase alpha-1 subunit and decreased Dm15 mRNA levels. Thus, altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to cataract formation. As ocular cataracts are a characteristic feature of DM, these results demonstrate that decreased SIX5 transcription is important in the aetiology of DM. Our data support the hypothesis that DM is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the partial loss of both DMPK and SIX5.. \n", {"entities": [[21, 25, "GENE"], [399, 403, "GENE"], [725, 729, "GENE"], [1129, 1133, "GENE"], [1189, 1193, "GENE"], [1304, 1308, "GENE"], [1347, 1351, "GENE"], [1360, 1364, "GENE"], [1661, 1665, "GENE"], [1837, 1841, "GENE"], [356, 360, "GENE"], [576, 580, "GENE"], [610, 614, "GENE"], [955, 959, "GENE"], [1828, 1832, "GENE"], [21, 25, "GENE"], [399, 403, "GENE"], [725, 729, "GENE"], [1129, 1133, "GENE"], [1189, 1193, "GENE"], [1304, 1308, "GENE"], [1347, 1351, "GENE"], [1360, 1364, "GENE"], [1661, 1665, "GENE"], [1837, 1841, "GENE"], [356, 360, "GENE"], [576, 580, "GENE"], [610, 614, "GENE"], [955, 959, "GENE"], [1828, 1832, "GENE"], [356, 360, "GENE"], [576, 580, "GENE"], [610, 614, "GENE"], [955, 959, "GENE"], [1828, 1832, "GENE"], [21, 25, "GENE"], [399, 403, "GENE"], [725, 729, "GENE"], [1129, 1133, "GENE"], [1189, 1193, "GENE"], [1304, 1308, "GENE"], [1347, 1351, "GENE"], [1360, 1364, "GENE"], [1661, 1665, "GENE"], [1837, 1841, "GENE"], [356, 360, "GENE"], [576, 580, "GENE"], [610, 614, "GENE"], [955, 959, "GENE"], [1828, 1832, "GENE"], [21, 25, "GENE"], [399, 403, "GENE"], [725, 729, "GENE"], [1129, 1133, "GENE"], [1189, 1193, "GENE"], [1304, 1308, "GENE"], [1347, 1351, "GENE"], [1360, 1364, "GENE"], [1661, 1665, "GENE"], [1837, 1841, "GENE"], [21, 25, "GENE"], [399, 403, "GENE"], [725, 729, "GENE"], [1129, 1133, "GENE"], [1189, 1193, "GENE"], [1304, 1308, "GENE"], [1347, 1351, "GENE"], [1360, 1364, "GENE"], [1661, 1665, "GENE"], [1837, 1841, "GENE"], [21, 25, "GENE"], [399, 403, "GENE"], [725, 729, "GENE"], [1129, 1133, "GENE"], [1189, 1193, "GENE"], [1304, 1308, "GENE"], [1347, 1351, "GENE"], [1360, 1364, "GENE"], [1661, 1665, "GENE"], [1837, 1841, "GENE"], [21, 25, "GENE"], [399, 403, "GENE"], [725, 729, "GENE"], [1129, 1133, "GENE"], [1189, 1193, "GENE"], [1304, 1308, "GENE"], [1347, 1351, "GENE"], [1360, 1364, "GENE"], [1661, 1665, "GENE"], [1837, 1841, "GENE"], [21, 25, "GENE"], [399, 403, "GENE"], [725, 729, "GENE"], [1129, 1133, "GENE"], [1189, 1193, "GENE"], [1304, 1308, "GENE"], [1347, 1351, "GENE"], [1360, 1364, "GENE"], [1661, 1665, "GENE"], [1837, 1841, "GENE"], [356, 360, "GENE"], [576, 580, "GENE"], [610, 614, "GENE"], [955, 959, "GENE"], [1828, 1832, "GENE"], [64, 73, "DISEASE"], [75, 93, "DISEASE"], [95, 97, "DISEASE"], [105, 131, "DISEASE"], [159, 173, "DISEASE"], [175, 183, "DISEASE"], [185, 203, "DISEASE"], [205, 222, "DISEASE"], [224, 242, "DISEASE"], [254, 263, "DISEASE"], [269, 283, "DISEASE"], [287, 289, "DISEASE"], [496, 498, "DISEASE"], [998, 1000, "DISEASE"], [1079, 1107, "DISEASE"], [1142, 1144, "DISEASE"], [1261, 1269, "DISEASE"], [1544, 1552, "DISEASE"], [1574, 1583, "DISEASE"], [1616, 1618, "DISEASE"], [1713, 1715, "DISEASE"], [1754, 1756, "DISEASE"]]}], ["Utility values were derived from EQ-5D-3\u00a0L.

The principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs  > C22  0, mainly C26  0), which is due to impaired capacity for beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. Diagnosis is usually based on the VLCFA levels in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts in both patients and carriers.

Of particular concern are female members of kindreds segregating X-ALD mutations, because normal VLCFA levels do not guarantee lack of carrier status.

In addition to the epidemiologic data, molecular genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor may be involved in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis. A major function of APC is the downregulation of beta-catenin, a transcription-activating protein with oncogenic potential. In an ongoing immunohistochemical study of beta-catenin expression in sporadic cases of tumor types that are associated with adenomatous polyposis coli, we observed increased beta-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of three investigated hepatoblastomas.

The unambiguous identification of a crossover event within hemochromatosis families is very difficult; it is particularly hampered by the variability of the phenotypic expression as well as by the sex- and age-related penetrance of the disease. For these practical considerations, traditional linkage analysis could prove of limited value in further refining the extrapolated physical position of HFE. We therefore embarked upon a linkage-disequilibrium analysis of HFE and normal chromosomes from the Brittany population. In the present report, 66 hemochromatosis families yielding 151 hemochromatosis chromosomes and 182 normal chromosomes were RFLP-typed with a battery of probes, including two newly derived polymorphic markers from the 6. 7 and HLA-F loci located 150 and 250 kb telomeric to HLA-A, respectively. The results suggest a strong peak of existing linkage disequilibrium focused within the i82-to-6. 7 interval (approximately 250 kb). The zone of linkage disequilibrium is flanked by the i97 locus, positioned 30 kb proximal to i82, and the HLA-F gene, found 250 kb distal to HLA-A, markers of which display no significant association with HFE. These data support the possibility that HFE resides within the 400-kb expanse of DNA between i97 and HLA-F. Alternatively, the very tight association of HLA-A3 and allele 1 of the 6. 7 locus, both of which are comprised by the major ancestral or founder HFE haplotype in Brittany, supports the possibility that the disease gene may reside immediately telomeric to the 6. 7 locus within the linkage-disequilibrium zone. Additionally, hemochromatosis haplotypes possessing HLA-A11 and the low-frequency HLA-F polymorphism (allele 2) are supportive of a separate founder chromosome containing a second, independently arising mutant allele. Overall, the establishment of a likely \" hemochromatosis critical region \" centromeric boundary and the identification of a linkage-disequilibrium zone both significantly contribute to a reduction in the amount of DNA required to be searched for novel coding sequences constituting the HFE defect \n", {"entities": [[39, 44, "GENE"], [1112, 1117, "GENE"], [1407, 1412, "GENE"], [122, 125, "GENE"], [153, 156, "GENE"], [712, 715, "GENE"], [781, 784, "GENE"], [1471, 1474, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1730, 1733, "GENE"], [2399, 2402, "GENE"], [122, 125, "GENE"], [153, 156, "GENE"], [712, 715, "GENE"], [781, 784, "GENE"], [1471, 1474, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1730, 1733, "GENE"], [2399, 2402, "GENE"], [39, 42, "GENE"], [205, 208, "GENE"], [1065, 1068, "GENE"], [1112, 1115, "GENE"], [1372, 1375, "GENE"], [1407, 1410, "GENE"], [1577, 1580, "GENE"], [1629, 1632, "GENE"], [1947, 1950, "GENE"], [1977, 1980, "GENE"], [122, 125, "GENE"], [153, 156, "GENE"], [712, 715, "GENE"], [781, 784, "GENE"], [1471, 1474, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1730, 1733, "GENE"], [2399, 2402, "GENE"], [122, 125, "GENE"], [153, 156, "GENE"], [712, 715, "GENE"], [781, 784, "GENE"], [1471, 1474, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1730, 1733, "GENE"], [2399, 2402, "GENE"], [1065, 1070, "GENE"], [1372, 1377, "GENE"], [1577, 1582, "GENE"], [1977, 1982, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [1112, 1117, "GENE"], [1407, 1412, "GENE"], [1065, 1070, "GENE"], [1372, 1377, "GENE"], [1577, 1582, "GENE"], [1977, 1982, "GENE"], [39, 44, "GENE"], [1112, 1117, "GENE"], [1407, 1412, "GENE"], [122, 125, "GENE"], [153, 156, "GENE"], [712, 715, "GENE"], [781, 784, "GENE"], [1471, 1474, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1730, 1733, "GENE"], [2399, 2402, "GENE"], [122, 125, "GENE"], [153, 156, "GENE"], [712, 715, "GENE"], [781, 784, "GENE"], [1471, 1474, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1730, 1733, "GENE"], [2399, 2402, "GENE"], [122, 125, "GENE"], [153, 156, "GENE"], [712, 715, "GENE"], [781, 784, "GENE"], [1471, 1474, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1730, 1733, "GENE"], [2399, 2402, "GENE"], [1065, 1070, "GENE"], [1372, 1377, "GENE"], [1577, 1582, "GENE"], [1977, 1982, "GENE"], [122, 125, "GENE"], [153, 156, "GENE"], [712, 715, "GENE"], [781, 784, "GENE"], [1471, 1474, "GENE"], [1516, 1519, "GENE"], [1730, 1733, "GENE"], [2399, 2402, "GENE"], [100, 115, "DISEASE"], [131, 146, "DISEASE"], [374, 389, "DISEASE"], [864, 879, "DISEASE"], [902, 917, "DISEASE"], [1909, 1924, "DISEASE"], [2154, 2169, "DISEASE"], [2399, 2409, "DISEASE"]]}], ["We identified one patient with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and one HIV-1-infected individual with associated hypereosinophilia who demonstrated high numbers of CD4-CD8- T cells in peripheral blood.", {"entities": [[60, 68, "DISEASE"]]}], ["17-BMP suppression of LPS-induced TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and CXCL8 was measured by ELISA and GR phosphorylation was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blot.", {"entities": []}], ["During the last decade, coal-based sponge iron plants, a highly polluted industry, have grown rapidly in Barjora, India.", {"entities": []}], ["PGD 2 and its metabolite, but not PGE 2 and a panel of cytokines including TGF-\u03b2, were increased in CRS patients compared with controls.", {"entities": [[0, 3, "GENE"]]}], ["Molecular evidence for new mutation at the hprt locus in Lesch-Nyhan patients.\nHypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; EC2. 4. 2. 8), which functions in the metabolic salvage of purines, is encoded by an X-linked gene in man.

Here we describe two new families in which males affected with PMD were found to have a copy of PLP on the short arm of the X chromosome, in addition to a normal copy on Xq22. In the first family, the extra copy was first detected by the presence of heterozygosity of the AhaII dimorphism within the PLP gene.

Another three affected males from the family had similar findings. In a second unrelated family with signs of PMD, cytogenetic analysis showed a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome. In the inv (X) carried by several affected family members, FISH showed PLP signals at Xp11. 4 and Xq22. A third family has previously been reported, in which affected members had an extra copy of the PLP gene detected at Xq26 in a chromosome with an otherwise normal banding pattern.

Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer in some families. However, little is known about the contribution of BRCA1 mutations to breast cancer in the general population. We analyzed DNA samples from women enrolled in a population-based study of early-onset breast cancer to assess the spectrum and frequency of germ-line BRCA1 mutations in young women with breast cancer. METHODS. We studied 80 women in whom breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 35, and who were not selected on the basis of family history. Genomic DNA was studied for BRCA1 mutations by analysis involving single-strand conformation polymorphisms and with allele-specific assays. Alterations were defined by DNA sequencing. RESULTS. Germ-line BRCA1 mutations were identified in 6 of the 80 women. Four additional rare sequence variants of unknown functional importance were also identified. Two of the mutations and three of the rare sequence variants were found among the 39 women who reported no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. None of the mutations and only one of the rare variants was identified in a reference population of 73 unrelated subjects. CONCLUSIONS. Alterations in BRCA1 were identified in approximately 10 percent of this cohort of young women with breast cancer. The risk of harboring a mutation was not limited to women with family histories of breast or ovarian cancer. These results represent a minimal estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 mutations in this population. Comprehensive methods of identifying BRCA1 mutations and understanding their importance will be needed before testing of women in the general population can be undertaken.. \n", {"entities": [[0, 5, "GENE"], [119, 124, "GENE"], [260, 265, "GENE"], [471, 476, "GENE"], [695, 700, "GENE"], [870, 875, "GENE"], [1320, 1325, "GENE"], [1592, 1597, "GENE"], [1665, 1670, "GENE"], [0, 5, "GENE"], [119, 124, "GENE"], [260, 265, "GENE"], [471, 476, "GENE"], [695, 700, "GENE"], [870, 875, "GENE"], [1320, 1325, "GENE"], [1592, 1597, "GENE"], [1665, 1670, "GENE"], [0, 5, "GENE"], [119, 124, "GENE"], [260, 265, "GENE"], [471, 476, "GENE"], [695, 700, "GENE"], [870, 875, "GENE"], [1320, 1325, "GENE"], [1592, 1597, "GENE"], [1665, 1670, "GENE"], [0, 5, "GENE"], [119, 124, "GENE"], [260, 265, "GENE"], [471, 476, "GENE"], [695, 700, "GENE"], [870, 875, "GENE"], [1320, 1325, "GENE"], [1592, 1597, "GENE"], [1665, 1670, "GENE"], [0, 5, "GENE"], [119, 124, "GENE"], [260, 265, "GENE"], [471, 476, "GENE"], [695, 700, "GENE"], [870, 875, "GENE"], [1320, 1325, "GENE"], [1592, 1597, "GENE"], [1665, 1670, "GENE"], [0, 5, "GENE"], [119, 124, "GENE"], [260, 265, "GENE"], [471, 476, "GENE"], [695, 700, "GENE"], [870, 875, "GENE"], [1320, 1325, "GENE"], [1592, 1597, "GENE"], [1665, 1670, "GENE"], [0, 5, "GENE"], [119, 124, "GENE"], [260, 265, "GENE"], [471, 476, "GENE"], [695, 700, "GENE"], [870, 875, "GENE"], [1320, 1325, "GENE"], [1592, 1597, "GENE"], [1665, 1670, "GENE"], [0, 5, "GENE"], [119, 124, "GENE"], [260, 265, "GENE"], [471, 476, "GENE"], [695, 700, "GENE"], [870, 875, "GENE"], [1320, 1325, "GENE"], [1592, 1597, "GENE"], [1665, 1670, "GENE"], [0, 5, "GENE"], [119, 124, "GENE"], [260, 265, "GENE"], [471, 476, "GENE"], [695, 700, "GENE"], [870, 875, "GENE"], [1320, 1325, "GENE"], [1592, 1597, "GENE"], [1665, 1670, "GENE"], [65, 78, "DISEASE"], [165, 190, "DISEASE"], [279, 292, "DISEASE"], [407, 420, "DISEASE"], [507, 520, "DISEASE"], [559, 572, "DISEASE"], [1143, 1167, "DISEASE"], [1405, 1418, "DISEASE"], [1503, 1527, "DISEASE"]]}], ["There was a substantial reduction from baseline in mean average flow in the superior abdominal aorta after 4 weeks of NSBB therapy (4.49 \u00b1 0.98 versus 3.82 \u00b1 0.86\u2009L/min, P = 0.03) but there were no statistically significant differences in flow in any other vessels, even in patients with >25% decrease in heart rate (47% of patients).", {"entities": []}], ["Variants of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in Bulgarian populations.\nTen variants of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were identified in 22 patients with G6PD deficiency from three districts of Bulgaria.

At the cell surface, HFE complexes with transferrin receptor (TfR), increasing the dissociation constant of transferrin (Tf) for its receptor 10-fold (Gross, C. N ., Irrinki, A., Feder, J. N ., and Enns, C. A . (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 22068-22074; Feder, J. N., Penny, D. M., Irrinki, A., Lee, V. K., Lebron, J. A., Watson, N., Tsuchihashi, Z., Sigal, E., Bjorkman, P. J., and Schatzman, R. C. (1998) Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci. U S A 95, 1472-1477). HFE does not remain at the cell surface, but traffics with TfR to Tf-positive internal compartments (Gross et al., 1998). Using a HeLa cell line in which the expression of HFE is controlled by tetracycline, we show that the expression of HFE reduces 55Fe uptake from Tf by 33% but does not affect the endocytic or exocytic rates of TfR cycling. Therefore, HFE appears to reduce cellular acquisition of iron from Tf within endocytic compartments. HFE specifically reduces iron uptake from Tf, as non-Tf-mediated iron uptake from Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid is not altered. These results explain the decreased ferritin levels seen in our HeLa cell system and demonstrate the specific control of HFE over the Tf-mediated pathway of iron uptake.

The pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by overexpression of ALDRP in immortalized X-ALD cells. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of ALDP by ALDRP was not due to stabilization of the mutated ALDP itself. Moreover, we were able to restore the peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect in the liver of ALDP-deficient mice by stimulation of ALDRP and PMP70 gene expression through a dietary treatment with the peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate.
